abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by black-hole binary systems have the highest
  signal-to-noise ratio in LIGO and Virgo detectors when black-hole spins are aligned
  with the orbital angular momentum and extremal. For such systems, we extend the
  effective-one-body inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms to generic mass ratios and
  spins calibrating them to 38 numerical-relativity nonprecessing waveforms produced
  by the SXS Collaboration. The numerical-relativity simulations span mass ratios
  from 1 to 8, spin magnitudes up to 98% of extremality, and last for 40 to 60 gravitational-wave
  cycles. When the total mass of the binary is between 20 and 200 M⊙, the effective-one-body
  nonprecessing (dominant mode) waveforms have overlap above 99%(using the advanced-LIGO
  design noise spectral density) with all of the 38 nonprecessing numerical waveforms,
  when maximizing only on initial phase and time. This implies a …
