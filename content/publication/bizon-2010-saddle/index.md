abstract: 'We consider the Cauchy problem for a spherically symmetric SU (2) Yang–Mills
  field propagating outside the Schwarzschild black hole. Although solutions starting
  from smooth finite energy initial data remain smooth for all times, not all of them
  scatter since there are non-generic solutions which asymptotically tend towards
  unstable static solutions. We show that a static solution with one unstable mode
  appears as an intermediate attractor in the evolution of initial data near a border
  between basins of attraction of two different vacuum states. We study the saddle-point
  dynamics near this attractor; in particular, we identify the universal phases of
  evolution: the ringdown approach, the exponential departure and the eventual decay
  to one of the vacuum states.'
