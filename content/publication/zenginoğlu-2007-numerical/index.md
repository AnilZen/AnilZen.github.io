abstract: After describing in short some problems and methods regarding the smoothness
  of null infinity for isolated systems, I present numerical calculations in which
  both spatial and null infinity can be studied. The reduced conformal field equations
  based on the conformal Gauss gauge allow us in spherical symmetry to calculate numerically
  the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal spacetime in a smooth way including spacelike,
  null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the singularity.
