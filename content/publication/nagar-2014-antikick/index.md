abstract: Gravitational waves emitted from a generic binary black hole merger carry
  away linear momentum anisotropically, resulting in a gravitational recoil, or “kick,”
  of the center of mass. For certain merger configurations the time evolution of the
  magnitude of the kick velocity has a local maximum followed by a sudden drop. Perturbative
  studies of this “antikick” in a limited range of black hole spins have found that
  the antikick decreases for retrograde orbits as a function of negative spin. We
  analyze this problem using a recently developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations
  from a point particle in Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed
  radiation reaction force at linear order in the mass ratio ν≪ 1. Extending previous
  studies to nearly extremal negative spins, thus complementing current numerical
  relativity knowledge about the recoil, we find that the well-known decrease of the
  antikick is overturned …
