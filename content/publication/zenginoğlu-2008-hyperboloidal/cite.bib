 abstract = {A useful choice of gauge when including null infinity in the computational domain is scri-fixing, that is, fixing the spatial coordinate location of null infinity. This choice allows us to avoid the introduction of artificial timelike outer boundaries in numerical calculations. We construct manifestly stationary scri-fixing coordinates explicitly on Minkowski, Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.},
