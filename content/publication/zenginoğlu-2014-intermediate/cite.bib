 abstract = {The numerical investigation of wave propagation in the asymptotic domain of Kerr spacetime has only recently been possible thanks to the construction of suitable hyperboloidal coordinates. The asymptotics revealed an apparent puzzle in the decay rates of scalar fields: the late-time rates seemed to depend on whether finite distance observers are in the strong field domain or far away from the rotating black hole, an apparent phenomenon dubbed ‘splitting.’ We discuss far-field ‘splitting’ in the full field and near-horizon ‘splitting’ in certain projected modes using horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates. For either case we propose an explanation to the cause of the ‘splitting’ behavior, and we determine uniquely decay rates that previous studies found to be ambiguous or immeasurable. The far-field ‘splitting’ is explained by competition between projected modes. The near-horizon ‘splitting’ is due to …},
