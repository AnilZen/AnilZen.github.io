abstract: 'The numerical investigation of wave propagation in the asymptotic domain
  of Kerr spacetime has only recently been possible thanks to the construction of
  suitable hyperboloidal coordinates. The asymptotics revealed an apparent puzzle
  in the decay rates of scalar fields: the late-time rates seemed to depend on whether
  finite distance observers are in the strong field domain or far away from the rotating
  black hole, an apparent phenomenon dubbed ‘splitting.’ We discuss far-field ‘splitting’
  in the full field and near-horizon ‘splitting’ in certain projected modes using
  horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates. For either case we propose an explanation
  to the cause of the ‘splitting’ behavior, and we determine uniquely decay rates
  that previous studies found to be ambiguous or immeasurable. The far-field ‘splitting’
  is explained by competition between projected modes. The near-horizon ‘splitting’
  is due to …'
