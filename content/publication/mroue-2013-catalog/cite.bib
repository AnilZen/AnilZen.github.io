 abstract = {This Letter presents a publicly available catalog of 174 numerical binary black hole simulations following up to 35 orbits. The catalog includes 91 precessing binaries, mass ratios up to 8∶ 1, orbital eccentricities from a few percent to 10− 5, black hole spins up to 98% of the theoretical maximum, and radiated energies up to 11.1% of the initial mass. We establish remarkably good agreement with post-Newtonian precession of orbital and spin directions for two new precessing simulations, and we discuss other applications of this catalog. Formidable challenges remain: eg, precession complicates the connection of numerical and approximate analytical waveforms, and vast regions of the parameter space remain unexplored.},
