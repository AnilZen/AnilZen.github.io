abstract: 'This Letter presents a publicly available catalog of 174 numerical binary
  black hole simulations following up to 35 orbits. The catalog includes 91 precessing
  binaries, mass ratios up to 8∶1, orbital eccentricities from a few percent to $10^{−5}$, 
  black hole spins up to 98% of the theoretical maximum, and radiated energies
  up to 11.1% of the initial mass. We establish remarkably good agreement with post-Newtonian
  precession of orbital and spin directions for two new precessing simulations, and
  we discuss other applications of this catalog. Formidable challenges remain: eg.,
  precession complicates the connection of numerical and approximate analytical waveforms,
  and vast regions of the parameter space remain unexplored.'
