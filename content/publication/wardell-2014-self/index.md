abstract: A compact object moving in curved spacetime interacts with its own gravitational
  field. This leads to both dissipative and conservative corrections to the motion,
  which can be interpreted as a self-force acting on the object. The original formalism
  describing this self-force relied heavily on the Green function of the linear differential
  operator that governs gravitational perturbations. However, because the global calculation
  of Green functions in nontrivial black-hole spacetimes has been an open problem
  until recently, alternative methods were established to calculate self-force effects
  using sophisticated regularization techniques that avoid the computation of the
  global Green function. We present a method for calculating the self-force that employs
  the global Green function and is therefore closely modeled after the original self-force
  expressions. Our quantitative method involves two stages:(i) numerical approximation
