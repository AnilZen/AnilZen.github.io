 abstract = {A compact object moving in curved spacetime interacts with its own gravitational field. This leads to both dissipative and conservative corrections to the motion, which can be interpreted as a self-force acting on the object. The original formalism describing this self-force relied heavily on the Green function of the linear differential operator that governs gravitational perturbations. However, because the global calculation of Green functions in nontrivial black-hole spacetimes has been an open problem until recently, alternative methods were established to calculate self-force effects using sophisticated regularization techniques that avoid the computation of the global Green function. We present a method for calculating the self-force that employs the global Green function and is therefore closely modeled after the original self-force expressions. Our quantitative method involves two stages:(i) numerical approximation of …},
