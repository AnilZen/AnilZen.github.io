abstract: We study the horizon absorption of gravitational waves in coalescing, circularized,
  nonspinning black-hole binaries. The horizon-absorbed fluxes of a binary with a
  large mass ratio (q= 1000) obtained by numerical perturbative simulations are compared
  with an analytical, effective-one-body (EOB) resummed expression recently proposed.
  The perturbative method employs an analytical, linear in the mass ratio, EOB-resummed
  radiation reaction, and the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalism for wave extraction.
  Hyperboloidal layers are employed for the numerical solution of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli
  equations to accurately compute horizon fluxes up to the late plunge phase. The
  horizon fluxes from perturbative simulations and the EOB-resummed expression agree
  at the level of a few percent down to the late plunge. An upgrade of the EOB model
  for nonspinning binaries that includes horizon absorption of angular …
