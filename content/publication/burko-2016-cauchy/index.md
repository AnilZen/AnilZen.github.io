abstract: The Cauchy horizon inside a perturbed Kerr black hole develops an instability
  that transforms it into a curvature singularity. We solve for the linearized Weyl
  scalars $ψ_0$ and $ψ_4$ and for the curvature scalar $R_{α β γ δ} R^{α β γ δ}$ along outgoing
  null rays approaching the Cauchy horizon in the interior of perturbed Kerr black
  holes using the Teukolsky equation, and compare our results with those found in
  perturbation analysis. Our results corroborate the previous perturbation analysis
  result that at its early parts the Cauchy horizon evolves into a deformationally
  weak, null, scalar-curvature singularity. We find excellent agreement for $ψ_0(u=$
  const$, v)$, where $u, v$ are advanced and retarded times, respectively. We do find,
  however, that the exponential growth rate of $R_{α β γ δ} R^{α β γ δ} (u=$const$, v)$ approaching
  the singularity is dramatically slower than that found in perturbation analysis,
  and that the angular frequency is in excellent agreement.

  <h4>Erratum</h4>
  In this Erratum we correct the behavior of the Weyl scalar $ψ_4$ and of the
  linearized curvature scalar $K≔ R_{αβγδ}R^{αβγδ}$ approaching the mass-inflation singularity
  along an outgoing null direction. In the original paper... <br>
