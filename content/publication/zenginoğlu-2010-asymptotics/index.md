abstract: We study linear gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime by
  solving numerically Regge–Wheeler–Zerilli equations in a time domain using hyperboloidal
  surfaces and a compactifying radial coordinate. We stress the importance of including
  the asymptotic region in the computational domain in studies of gravitational radiation.
  The hyperboloidal approach should be helpful in a wide range of applications employing
  black hole perturbation theory.
