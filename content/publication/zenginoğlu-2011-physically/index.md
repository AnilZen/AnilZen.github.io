abstract: Black hole perturbation theory is typically studied on time surfaces that
  extend between the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. I will argue that--from
  a physical point of view--it is favorable to employ time surfaces that extend between
  the future event horizon and future null infinity. I will demonstrate how this new
  approach resolves problems related to the representation of quasinormal mode eigenfunctions,
  the construction of short-ranged potentials for curvature perturbations, and the
  numerical calculation of gravitational waveforms as measured by an idealized observer.
