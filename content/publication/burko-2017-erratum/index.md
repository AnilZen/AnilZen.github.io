abstract: In this Erratum we correct the behavior of the Weyl scalar ψ4 and of the
  linearized curvature scalar K≔ RαβγδRαβγδ approaching the mass-inflation singularity
  along an outgoing null direction. In the original paper we used a second-order code,
  that allowed us to find very accurately the fields in the exterior and on the event
  horizon. However, it has some disadvantages approaching the Cauchy horizon (CH).
  Specifically, our code solves for Δ− 2ψ4, which diverges exponentially with advanced
  time approaching the CH (more specifically, diverges likee2v= M). Moreover, in the
  code’s coordinates this field
