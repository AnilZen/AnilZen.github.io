 abstract = {In this Erratum we correct the behavior of the Weyl scalar ψ4 and of the linearized curvature scalar K≔ RαβγδRαβγδ approaching the mass-inflation singularity along an outgoing null direction. In the original paper we used a second-order code, that allowed us to find very accurately the fields in the exterior and on the event horizon. However, it has some disadvantages approaching the Cauchy horizon (CH). Specifically, our code solves for Δ− 2ψ4, which diverges exponentially with advanced time approaching the CH (more specifically, diverges likee2v= M). Moreover, in the code’s coordinates this field},
