abstract: We consider the initial value problem for the spherically symmetric, focusing
  cubic wave equation in three spatial dimensions. We give numerical and analytical
  evidence for the existence of a universal attractor which encompasses both global
  and blowup solutions. As a byproduct we get an explicit description of the critical
  behaviour at the threshold of blowup.
