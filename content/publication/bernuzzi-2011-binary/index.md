abstract: We discuss the properties of the effective-one-body (EOB) multipolar gravitational
  waveform emitted by nonspinning black-hole binaries of masses μ and M in the extreme-mass-ratio
  limit μ/M= ν≪ 1. We focus on the transition from quasicircular inspiral to plunge,
  merger, and ringdown. We compare the EOB waveform to a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli waveform
  computed using the hyperboloidal layer method and extracted at null infinity. Because
  the EOB waveform keeps track analytically of most phase differences in the early
  inspiral, we do not allow for any arbitrary time or phase shift between the waveforms.
  The dynamics of the particle, common to both wave-generation formalisms, is driven
  by a leading-order O (ν) analytically resummed radiation reaction. The EOB and the
  Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli waveforms have an initial dephasing of about 5× 10− 4 rad
  and maintain then a remarkably accurate phase coherence …
