abstract: We compute and analyze the gravitational waveform emitted to future null
  infinity by a system of two black holes in the large-mass-ratio limit. We consider
  the transition from the quasiadiabatic inspiral to plunge, merger, and ringdown.
  The relative dynamics is driven by a leading order in the mass ratio, 5PN-resummed,
  effective-one-body (EOB), analytic-radiation reaction. To compute the waveforms,
  we solve the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations in the time-domain on a spacelike foliation,
  which coincides with the standard Schwarzschild foliation in the region including
  the motion of the small black hole, and is globally hyperboloidal, allowing us to
  include future null infinity in the computational domain by compactification. This
  method is called the hyperboloidal layer method, and is discussed here for the first
  time in a study of the gravitational radiation emitted by black hole binaries. We
  consider binaries …
