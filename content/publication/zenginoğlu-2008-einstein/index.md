abstract: We consider an approach to the hyperboloidal evolution problem based on
  the Einstein equations written for a rescaled metric. It is shown that a conformal
  scale factor can be freely prescribed a priori in terms of coordinates in a well-posed
  hyperboloidal initial value problem such that the location of null infinity is independent
  of the time coordinate. With an appropriate choice of a single gauge source function
  each of the formally singular conformal source terms in the equations attains a
  regular limit at null infinity. The suggested approach could be beneficial in numerical
  relativity for both wave extraction and outer boundary treatment.
