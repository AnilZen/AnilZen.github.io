 abstract = {We consider an approach to the hyperboloidal evolution problem based on the Einstein equations written for a rescaled metric. It is shown that a conformal scale factor can be freely prescribed a priori in terms of coordinates in a well-posed hyperboloidal initial value problem such that the location of null infinity is independent of the time coordinate. With an appropriate choice of a single gauge source function each of the formally singular conformal source terms in the equations attains a regular limit at null infinity. The suggested approach could be beneficial in numerical relativity for both wave extraction and outer boundary treatment.},
