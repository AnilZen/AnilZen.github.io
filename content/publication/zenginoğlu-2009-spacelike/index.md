abstract: We present two methods to include the asymptotic domain of a background
  spacetime in null directions for numerical solutions of evolution equations so that
  both the radiation extraction problem and the outer boundary problem are solved.
  The first method is based on the geometric conformal approach, the second is a coordinate
  based approach. We apply these methods to the case of a massless scalar wave equation
  on a Kerr spacetime. Our methods are designed to allow existing codes to reach the
  radiative zone by including future null infinity in the computational domain with
  relatively minor modifications. We demonstrate the flexibility of the methods by
  considering both Boyer-Lindquist and ingoing Kerr coordinates near the black hole.
  We also confirm numerically predictions concerning tail decay rates for scalar fields
  at null infinity in Kerr spacetime due to Hod for the first time.
