abstract: We show how to solve hyperbolic equations numerically on unbounded domains
  by compactification, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial outer boundary.
  The essential ingredient is a suitable transformation of the time coordinate in
  combination with spatial compactification. We construct a new layer method based
  on this idea, called the hyperboloidal layer. The method is demonstrated on numerical
  tests including the one dimensional Maxwell equations using finite differences and
  the three dimensional wave equation with and without nonlinear source terms using
  spectral techniques.
