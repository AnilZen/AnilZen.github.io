abstract: The supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of our Galaxy is a source
  of bright X-ray flares. In certain cases, the bright flares are followed up by weaker
  ones, also referred to as X-ray hiccups. A recent X-ray Visionary Project (XVP)
  using the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) of the Chandra X-ray
  Observatory is expected to observe about three dozen X-ray flares within 2012, thereby
  providing a unique opportunity to understand the mechanism behind X-ray flares in
  accretion disks around supermassive black holes and their follow-ups. Such follow-ups
  may also appear due to caustic echoes. A bright flare near the event horizon of
  a black hole leads to the formation of a caustic on the other side of the horizon.
  The echoes generated by these caustics may, in principle, be detected as X-ray follow-ups
  with sufficiently accurate instruments. Their detection would allow us to measure
  the …
