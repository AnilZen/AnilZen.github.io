abstract: A source of waves (scalar, electromagnetic, or gravitational) near the event
  horizon of a black hole leads to the formation of a caustic on the other side of
  the horizon. The caustic forms from the trapping of energy by the strong curvature
  near the black hole and leads to echoes of the source that may have astrophysical
  consequences. In this talk, I briefly review the main properties of``caustic echoes''and
  discuss some potential astrophysical applications that may also be relevant for
  future gravitational wave searches.
