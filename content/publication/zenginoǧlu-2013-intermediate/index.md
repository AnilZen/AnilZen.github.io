abstract: "The numerical investigation of wave propagation in the asymptotic domain\
  \ of Kerr spacetime has only recently been possible thanks to the construction of\
  \ suitable hyperboloidal coordinates. The asymptotics revealed a puzzle in the decay\
  \ rates of scalar fields: the late-time rates seemed to depend on whether finite\
  \ distance observers are in the strong field domain or far away from the rotating\
  \ black hole, an apparent phenomenon dubbedsplitting'. We discuss far-field splitting\
  \ in the full field and near-horizon splitting in certain projected modes using\
  \ horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates. For either case we propose an\
  \ explanation to the cause of the splitting behavior. The far-field splitting is\
  \ explained by competition between projected modes. The near-horizon splitting is\
  \ due to excitation of lower multipole modes that back excite the multipole mode\
  \ for which splitting is observed. In both cases splitting is an …"
