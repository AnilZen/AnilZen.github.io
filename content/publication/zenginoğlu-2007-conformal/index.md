abstract: This thesis is concerned with the development and application of conformal
  techniques to numerical calculations of asymptotically flat spacetimes. The conformal
  compactification technique enables us to calculate spatially unbounded domains,
  thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial timelike outer boundary. We construct
  in spherical symmetry an explicit scri-fixing gauge, ie a conformal and a coordinate
  gauge in which the spatial coordinate location of null infinity is independent of
  time so that no resolution loss in the physical part of the conformal extension
  appears. Going beyond spherical symmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity
  in the computational domain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems
  for the Einstein equations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To
  study spatial infinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general
  conformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the first
  numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution including spatial,
  null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the singularity. After developing
  a three dimensional, frame based evolution code with smooth inner and outer boundaries
  we calculate a radiative axisymmetric vacuum solution in a neighbourhood of spatial
  infinity represented as a cylinder including a piece of null infinity. In this context,
  a certain component of the rescaled Weyl tensor representing the radiation field
  is calculated unambiguously with respect to an adapted tetrad at null infinity.
