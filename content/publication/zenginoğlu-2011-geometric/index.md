abstract: Black hole perturbation theory is typically studied on time surfaces that
  extend between the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. From a physical point
  of view, however, it may be favorable to employ time surfaces that extend between
  the future event horizon and future null infinity. This framework resolves problems
  regarding the representation of quasinormal mode eigenfunctions and the construction
  of short-ranged potentials for the perturbation equations in frequency domain.
