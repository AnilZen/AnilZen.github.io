  abstract    = {We investigate the asymptotic behavior of spherically symmetric solutions to scalar wave and Yang–Mills equations on a Schwarzschild background. The studies demonstrate the astrophysical relevance of null infinity in predicting radiation signals for gravitational wave detectors and show how test fields on unbounded domains in black hole spacetimes can be simulated conveniently by numerically solving hyperboloidal initial value problems.},
