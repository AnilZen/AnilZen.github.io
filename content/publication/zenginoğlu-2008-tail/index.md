abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of spherically symmetric solutions
  to scalar wave and Yang–Mills equations on a Schwarzschild background. The studies
  demonstrate the astrophysical relevance of null infinity in predicting radiation
  signals for gravitational wave detectors and show how test fields on unbounded domains
  in black hole spacetimes can be simulated conveniently by numerically solving hyperboloidal
  initial value problems.
