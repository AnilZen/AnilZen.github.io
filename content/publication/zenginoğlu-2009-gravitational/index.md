abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime by solving
  a hyperboloidal initial value problem for the Bardeen–Press equation. Compactification
  along hyperboloidal surfaces in a scri-fixing gauge allows us to have access to
  the gravitational waveform at null infinity in a general setup. We argue that this
  hyperboloidal approach leads to a more accurate and efficient calculation of the
  radiation signal than the common approach where a timelike outer boundary is introduced.
  The method can be generalized to study perturbations of Kerr spacetime using the
  Teukolsky equation.
