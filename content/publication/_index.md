Most of my publications are concerned with the hyperboloidal method, which is a technique to *follow light to infinity* using suitable coordinates for numerical computations. Originally motivated by gravitational waves, explorations of this technique led me to many other topics such as black hole perturbation theory, numerical methods, and PDE analysis.

#### Highlights
- A practical method that solves the *outer boundary problem* and the *radiation extraction problem* in numerical calculations of wave equations [[1]](/publication/zenginoglu-2011-hyperboloidal/).
- First horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates [[2]](/publication/zenginoglu-2008-hyperboloidal/), [[3]](/publication/zenginoglu-2011-geometric/) and the first numerical computations with such coordinates [[4]](/publication/zenginoglu-2008-tail/), [[5]](/publication/zenginoglu-2009-gravitational/), [[6]](/publication/zenginoglu-2010-asymptotics/).
- First global approximation of a black hole Green function in time domain (with Chad Galley) [[7]](/publication/zenginoglu-2012-caustic/). We explained the shape of caustic echoes from black holes by an optical effect discovered in 1890.
- First gravitational waves at null infinity on the background of a rotating black hole demonstrating an efficiency gain of at least 5000 in one simulation (with Gaurav Khanna) [[8]](/publication/zenginoglu-2011-null/).
- Two papers [[9]](/publication/mroue-2013-catalog/), [[10]](/publication/pan-2014-eob/) published as part of the [Simulating-eXtreme-Spacetimes Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org/) have been cited by the first detection of gravitational waves that led to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.

#### Statistical summary (as of Oct 2021)

Published 28 refereed journal articles and 2 conference papers with about 1900 citations (about 500 normalized). Of the refereed articles, 6 have been published as single author, 13 with a small group (one or two co-authors), and 9 with a larger group (three or more co-authors); h-index 22, i10-index 30.
