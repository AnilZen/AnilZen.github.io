Most of my publications are concerned with the hyperboloidal method, which is a technique to *follow the light to infinity* using suitable coordinates for numerical computations. Explorations of this technique led me to various topics such as development of computational methods, PDE analysis, black hole perturbation theory, and gravitational waves.

#### Highlights
- I pioneered the use of horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates in black hole perturbation theory [[1]](/publication/zenginoglu-2008-hyperboloidal/), [[2]](/publication/zenginoglu-2011-geometric/) and performed the first numerical computations with such coordinates [[3]](/publication/zenginoglu-2008-tail/), [[4]](/publication/zenginoglu-2009-gravitational/), [[5]](/publication/zenginoglu-2010-asymptotics/).
- I developed a practical method that solves the *outer boundary problem* and the *radiation extraction problem* in numerical calculations of wave equations [[6]](/publication/zenginoglu-2011-hyperboloidal/).
- Together with Chad Galley, I computed the first global approximation of a black hole Green function in the time domain and explained the shape of caustic echoes from black holes by an optical effect discovered in 1890 [[7]](/publication/zenginoglu-2012-caustic/).
- Together with Gaurav Khanna, I computed the first gravitational waves at null infinity on the background of a rotating black hole demonstrating an efficiency gain of at least 5000 in one simulation [[8]](/publication/zenginoglu-2011-null/).
- Two of my papers published as part of the [Simulating-eXtreme-Spacetimes Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org/) have been cited by the first detection of gravitational waves which led to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics [[9]](/publication/mroue-2013-catalog/), [[10]](/publication/pan-2014-eob/).

#### Statistical summary

I published 28 refereed journal articles and 2 conference papers with about 1800 citations (about 500 normalized). Out of these, 6 articles have been published as single author, 13 with a small group (one or two co-authors), and 9 with a larger group (three or more co-authors). My papers appeared in 8 refereed journals. My h-index is 22, i10-index is 29.
