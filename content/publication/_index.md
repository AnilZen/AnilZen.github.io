Most of my publications are concerned with the hyperboloidal method, which is a technique to *follow the light to infinity* using suitable coordinates for numerical computations. Explorations of this technique led me to various topics such as development of computational methods, PDE analysis, black hole perturbation theory, and gravitational waves.

#### Statistical summary

I published 28 refereed journal articles and 2 conference papers with about 1800 citations (about 500 normalized). Out of these, 6 articles have been published as single author, 13 with a small group (one or two co-authors), and 9 with a larger group (three or more co-authors). My papers appeared in 8 refereed journals. My h-index is 22, i10-index is 29.

#### Highlights
- My main contribution is the development of a method that solves the *outer boundary problem* and the *radiation extraction problem* for numerical calculations on given spacetimes. The method is now widely used not only in numerical relativity, but also in mathematical analysis.
- I pioneered the use of horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates in black hole perturbation theory.
- Two of my papers have been cited by the first detection of gravitational waves which led to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.
<!-- - Together with Chad Galley, we computed the first global approximation of a black hole Green function in the time domain.
- Together with Gaurav Khanna, we computed the first gravitational waves at null infinity on the background of a rotating black hole. -->
