Historically, hyperboloidal compactification has been mainly considered by mathematical relativists. After the explicit construction of [hyperboloidal scri-fixing](/content/publication/zenginoğlu-2008-hyperboloidal/) and the demonstration of its benefits for [scalar](/content/publication/zenginoğlu-2008-tail/) and [gravitational](/content/publication/zenginoğlu-2009-gravitational/) perturbations, the method has become a useful tool with applications to many areas of black-hole perturbation theory, including the self-force and effective-one-body approaches to the binary black-hole problem.

This project includes the following topics:
- **Astroseismology:** Extend the applications of hyperboloidal foliations to stellar oscillations.
- **Cosmological perturbations:** Investigate relativistic perturbations of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes using hyperboloidal methods.
- **Time-symmetric methods:** Explore the application of unconditionally stable time-symmetric integrators to long-time evolution of black-hole perturbations.
- **Massive fields at null infinity:** Study the asymptotic behavior of massive scalar fields near null infinity by using hyperboloidal compactification.
