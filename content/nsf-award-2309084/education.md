The educational aspects of the award revolve around three objectives:
- Develop a summer school on advanced numerical methods for solving wave equations using hyperboloidal foliations.
- Train a student in the interdisciplinary arts of numerical relativity and applied mathematics.
- Explain basic ideas of hyperboloidal methods and hyperbolic geometry through blog posts.

## Summer School

The summer school is an online, week-long event that I will hold in July 2025. The primary target for the summer school are advanced students in STEM programs in the [Washington–Baltimore Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%E2%80%93Baltimore_combined_statistical_area). I will particularly advertise the school in community colleges but it will be open to all interested students, at no cost, and available online. The school will be organized around a series of lectures, practical demonstrations, and hands-on coding sessions.

## Student Training

The award will partially support a graduate student. The student will pick a research topic from the areas supported by the award. They will present their work at conferences, participate in the summer school, and publish their results in peer-reviewed journals.

<!-- Ekrem Dağlıkoca is a PhD student in the [AMSC Program](https://amsc.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu). He is working with me on the computation of black-hole perturbations in cosmological spacetimes. He is expected to graduate in 2028. -->

## Blog posts

I publish [blog posts](/tag/hyperboloidal/) explaining hyperboloidal methods and hyperbolic geometry in general relativity and beyond. The posts are written at a level that is meant to be accessible to a beginning graduate student.
