The educational aspects of the award revolve around two objectives:
- Develop a summer school on advanced numerical methods for solving wave equations using hyperboloidal foliations.
- Train a student in the interdisciplinary arts of numerical relativity and applied mathematics.

## Summer School

The summer school is an online, week-long event that I will hold in July 2024. The primary target for the summer school are advanced students in STEM programs in the [Washington–Baltimore Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%E2%80%93Baltimore_combined_statistical_area). I will particularly advertise the school in community colleges but it will be open to all interested students, at no cost, and available online. The school will be organized around a series of lectures, practical demonstrations, and hands-on coding sessions.

## Student Training

The award will support a graduate student for two years. The student will pick a research project from the list of projects supported by the award. They will present their work at conferences, participate in the summer school, and publish their results in peer-reviewed journals.
