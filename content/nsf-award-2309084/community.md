A major objective that this award enables is building a community of researchers working with asymptotic methods in relativity. This is a relatively small community of geographically distributed but thematically focused researchers. 

During the years that I was out of active research, I worked as a coordinator of a similarly distributed research network in mathematical sciences on kinetic theory called [KI-Net](https://www.math.umd.edu/~tadmor/ki_net/). With this award, I will employ skills that I acquired during that time to build a community in my own field of research.

This is a joint effort with David Hilditch, Rodrigo Panosso Macedo, and Alex Vaño-Viñuales.

## Website
The community uses the aptly named website [hyperboloid.al](https://hyperboloid.al). All our events and activities are managed through this website. The website uses the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) research group theme; its source code is available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/anilzen/hyperboloid.al).

## Workshops
 The "inaugural" event of the community was the workshop  [Infinity on a Gridshell](https://hyperboloid.al/event/copenhagen-23/), held in July 2023 at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr_Institute) in Copenhagen. The [speakers](https://hyperboloid.al/copenhagen-23-talks/) covered a wide variety of topics including black-hole perturbation theory, mathematical analysis of wave equations, and nonlinear Einstein equations. The workshop was a great success and we are planning to hold another one in 2024.

## Topical Collection
We are planning to publish a topical collection in the journal General Relativity and Gravitation on the topic titled [_Hyperboloidal foliations in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy: from mathematical relativity to astrophysics_](https://link.springer.com/collections/jjghbiafhc). The guest editors for the collection are David Hilditch, Rodrigo Panosso Macedo, Alex Vañó Viñuales, and me. The collection will be open to all researchers working with hyperboloidal foliations. Submissions are accepted starting August 31, 2023.

For more information, please see the [collection website](https://link.springer.com/collections/jjghbiafhc).

## Virtual Seminars
We plan to initiate a series of virtual seminars starting September 2023. More information will be on our [website](https://hyperboloid.al).
