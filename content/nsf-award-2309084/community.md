A major objective that this award enables is building a community of researchers working with asymptotic methods in relativity. This is a relatively small community of geographically distributed but thematically focused researchers. 

During the years that I was out of active research, I worked as a coordinator of a similarly distributed research network in mathematical sciences on kinetic theory called [KI-Net](https://www.math.umd.edu/~tadmor/ki_net/). With this award, I will employ skills that I acquired during that time to build a community in my own field of research.

This is a joint effort with David Hilditch, Rodrigo Panosso Macedo, and Alex Vaño-Viñuales.

## Website
The community uses the aptly named website [hyperboloid.al](https://hyperboloid.al). All our events and activities are managed through this website. The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) research group theme. The source code for the website is available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/anilzen/hyperboloid.al).

## Workshops
 The "inaugural" event of the community was the workshop  [Infinity on a Gridshell](https://hyperboloid.al/event/copenhagen-23/), held in July 2023 at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr_Institute) in Copenhagen. The [speakers](https://hyperboloid.al/copenhagen-23-talks/) covered a wide variety of topics including black-hole perturbation theory, mathematical analysis of wave equations, and nonlinear Einstein equations. The workshop was a great success and we are planning to hold another one in 2024.

## Virtual Seminars
We plan to initiate a series of virtual seminars starting September 2023. More information will be on our [website](https://hyperboloid.al).
