The [Penrose diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram) is a valuable tool in relativity to illustrate the global causal structure of spacetimes[^1]. If you're mainly interested illustrating the essential causal relationships, qualitative diagrams may be sufficient. But for numerical work, it may be important to draw quantitatively correct diagrams.

Below, I show how to draw Penrose diagrams using the LaTeX package TikZ, which [is not a drawing program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) but a program that draws[^2]. We'll use Python to perform transformations when we hit the computational limitations of TikZ.

TikZ codes for all diagrams below are on my [website repository](https://github.com/anilzen/anilzen.github.io/tree/main/content/post/2022/drawing-penrose-diagrams/tikz).

### The basic idea behind Penrose diagrams

The Penrose diagram is an extension, or better, a *completion* of the [Minkowski diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram). Just like in the Minkowski diagram, time is vertical, space is horizontal, and null rays are at 45 degrees to the axes. In contrast to the Minkowski diagram, a Penrose diagram includes "points at infinity" added by compactification, thereby visualizing the rich structure of infinity arising from the unification of space and time.


Below are two beautiful [TikZ diagrams](https://tikz.net/relativity_penrose_diagram/) by [Izaak Neutelings](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/researcharea/cms/people/Izaak-Neutelings.html). On the left is the Minkowski diagram. Spacetime extends infinitely in all directions. On the right is the Penrose diagram, which represents the entire spacetime in a finite square.

The Minkowski diagram on the left is mapped to the Penrose diagram on the right. Compactification maps the null directions to a finite interval. Penrose used the inverse tangent function in his original papers but many other choices exist. We will play with them to illustrate some coordinate-dependent features in these diagrams.

### Minkowski spacetime
Consider the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with standard spherical coordinates: $t \in (-\infty,\infty)$, $r \in [0,\infty)$, $\theta\in[0,\pi]$, $\varphi\in[0,2\pi)$. The metric reads
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2, $$
where $d\sigma^2=d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\varphi^2$, the standard metric on the unit sphere. Penrose diagrams are two-dimensional, so we essentially ignore the angular coordinates (each point, except the origin, represents a sphere). Spherical light rays propagate along the directions $t+r$ and $t-r$. These directions are called [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_vector) because they are in the [nullspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(linear_algebra)) of the metric.

The core element of Penrose diagrams are coordinates, $T$ and $R$, which compactify these null directions:
$$ T+R = \frac{2}{\pi}\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\arctan}(t+r),$$ 
$$ T-R = \frac{2}{\pi}\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\arctan}(t-r). $$
The mapped range of the coordinates is $T\in(-1,1)$ and $R\in[0,1)$. Note that I'm not including the endpoints in the intervals yet. The Penrose compactification procedure involves the conformal completion of the spacetime which adds the points at infinity after a regularizing rescaling. This detail is not relevant for the diagrams but is important for geometry.

The Penrose coordinates $(T,R)$ read in terms of the standard $(t,r)$ as:
$$ T(t,r) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(t+r) + \arctan(t-r) \right)$$
$$ R(t,r) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(t+r) - \arctan(t-r) \right)$$

Let's make some plots. I'll demonstrate plotting time surfaces (level sets of a time coordinate). Say, you'd like to draw constant $t$ surfaces in the Penrose diagram. You might be tempted to solve the above relationships for a graph function $T(R;t)$ with constant $t$. But it is easier to let the machine do the work and plot the surfaces parametrically. Define the functions $T(t,r)$ and $R(t,r)$ in TikZ as follows:
```latex
\tikzset{declare function={
    T(\t,\r)  = \fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\t+\r) + atan(\t-\r))};
    R(\t,\r)  = \fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\t+\r) - atan(\t-\r))};
}}
```
Then, plot the lines parametrically. 
```latex
\def\Nlines{6} % total number of lines is 2\Nlines+1
\newcommand\samp[1]{ tan(90*#1) } % for equidistant sampling 
\foreach \i [evaluate={\t=\i/(\Nlines+1);}] in {-\Nlines,...,\Nlines}{
    \message{Drawing i=\i...^^J}
    \draw[line width=0.3,samples=30,smooth,variable=\r,domain=0.001:1]
    plot({ R(\samp{\t},\samp{\r}) }, { T(\samp{\t},\samp{\r}) });
}
```
A neat trick I got from [Neutelings](https://tikz.net/relativity_penrose_diagram/) is the sampling of points by incorporating the compactification into the plot function. As you can see in the diagrams below, the time surfaces are equally separated from each other at the origin. The function `samp` controls the separation of points in the plot.

I plotted two versions of the diagram to illustrate a coordinate-dependent feature that confuses even the experts. On both diagrams, the $t$ surfaces intersect at spatial infinity, $i^0$. On the left diagram, they are tangent to each other, while on the right diagram they are not. The intersection of the $t$ surfaces is an invariant feature, but their behavior near $i^0$ on the Penrose diagram depends on coordinates. The left diagram uses the tangens function for compactification. Many other functions map an infinite domain to a finite domain. For example, using the hyperbolic tangens, the mapping reads
$$ T+R = \textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\tanh}(t+r),$$ 
$$ T-R = \textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\tanh}(t-r), $$
which gives a diagram where $t$ surfaces are not tangent at spatial infinity.

I draw Penrose diagrams typically to present the causal structure of hyperboloidal surfaces. Such surfaces behave like spacetime hyperboloids: they are spacelike everywhere, including null horizons. In the literature, spacetime hyperboloids are typically defined by the level sets of $\tau$ as
$$ t^2 - r^2 = \tau^2. $$
This construction appears in many models, such as the [Milne model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model) of cosmology, [Dirac's point-form](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392) of relativistic dynamics, the [de Boer-Solodukhin](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0303006) holography of Minowski spacetime, and the [Buchholz-Roberts framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2794) of relativistic QED.

However, these surfaces are not generally useful to study evolution in time because they intersect at future null infinity. It is not immediately obvious from their definition that they do intersect at null infinity if you don't know to look for it. But on the Penrose diagram below, one immediately sees the intersection. 

|                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                     |

A better option for a foliation of Minkowski spacetime, illustrated on the right panel above, is to fix a hyperboloid, say, with unit radius, and shift it in time by $\tau$, like this
$$ (t-\tau)^2 - r^2 = 1 \implies \tau = t \pm \sqrt{1+r^2}. $$
Choosing the minus sign gives a future hyperboloidalÂ foliation. You can see on the diagram at the right panel that the surfaces do not intersect but provide a smooth foliation of future null infinity.

The causal structure of the time surfaces may not be immediately clear from the formulas. For example, many people find it counterintuitive that hyperboloidal surfaces are spacelike at null infinity or that standard time surfaces intersect at spatial infinity. We can demonstrate such properties by calculations, but it's much easier to view them on a Penrose diagram.

#### Reading data into TikZ
TikZ is limited in its data processing capabilities. As a consequence, the evaluation of the lines in the plots takes a while. Once you move away from Minkowski spacetime, the transformations become too complicated for TikZ. To handle complicated mathematical transformations, you can generate the data for the plots in Python, write them in a file, and plot them with TikZ. Below is the Python code to generate the data files for each time surface.

```python
import numpy as np
t = np.linspace(-np.pi/2.,np.pi/2,14,endpoint=False)[1:]
r = np.linspace(0,np.pi/2,30)
def penrose_coords(r,t):
    R = 1./np.pi*(np.arctan(t+r)-np.arctan(t-r))
    T = 1./np.pi*(np.arctan(t+r)+np.arctan(t-r))
    return R,T
for i, t_val in enumerate(t):
    R,T = penrose_coords(np.tan(r),np.tan(t_val))
    np.savetxt('arctan_data'+str(i)+'.csv',np.stack((R,T)).T, delimiter=',', fmt='%f', header="R,T", comments="")
```

You'll need the [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library installed in your environment (use [local environments for Python!](https://xkcd.com/1987/) The array `t` contains the constant values of the time surfaces; the array `r` includes the samples of the plot parameter. The domains stop at $\pi/2$ because we use the $\tan$ function to sample the points for a relatively even distribution. Then, for each value of `t`, we write the $R,T$ coordinates into a CSV file with headers and some formatting.

On the TikZ side, we simply read these points from the respective files and plot them. To plot data points, I use the library `pgfplots`. The nodes must be drawn with respect to the axis of the plot, which is achieved with the `axis cs:` directive. The relevant part of the code is below.

```latex
 \begin{axis}[axis lines=none, xmin=-.1,xmax=1.1,ymin=-1.2,ymax=1.2,width=0.5\textwidth,height=0.8\textwidth]

    \node[right] at (axis cs:0.6,1) {\small{$\arctan(\cdot)$}};
    \coordinate (O) at (axis cs:0,0) ; % center: origin (r,t) = (0,0)
    \coordinate (S) at ( axis cs:0,-1); % south: t=-infty, i-
    \coordinate (N) at ( axis cs:0, 1); % north: t=+infty, i+
    \coordinate (E) at ( axis cs:1, 0); % east:  r=+infty, i0
    \draw[thick] (N) -- (E) -- (S) -- cycle;

    \newcommand{\scri}{\mathscr{I}} % null infinity
    \node[right] at (E) {$i^0$};
    \node[above] at (N) {$i^+$};
    \node[below] at (S) {$i^-$};
    \node[above, rotate=90] at (O) {\small{$r=0$}};
    \node[above right] at (axis cs: 0.5,0.5) {$\scri^+$};
    \node[below right] at (axis cs: 0.5,-0.5) {$\scri^-$};
    
    \foreach \file in {{arctan_data0.csv},{arctan_data1.csv},{arctan_data2.csv},{arctan_data3.csv},
    			    {arctan_data4.csv},{arctan_data5.csv},{arctan_data6.csv}}
  	  {\addplot[domain={-1,1}] table [x=R, y=T, col sep=comma] {\file};}

\end{axis}
```
This is probably not the most elegant solution, but it works. If you're up for it, you might prefer using a Python library such as [tikzplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/tikzplotlib/) to avoid going back and forth between Python and TikZ.

### Schwarzschild spacetime

Penrose diagrams for Schwarzschild spacetime are traditionally introduced using [Kruskal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Szekeres_coordinates). These coordinates are good for plotting the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution. But it is not clear how physically meaningful the maximally extended solution is. We only have access to the exterior region beyond the event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole ($r>2M$). If you're primarily interested in the exterior region, Kruskal coordinates are unnecessarily complicated; you can draw a Penrose diagram for Schwarzschild just like in the Minkowski case by using the tortoise coordinate. The reason is that the $t,r$ portion of the Schwarzschild metric is conformally flat in the tortoise coordinate. Since Penrose diagrams are conformal diagrams, all the usual tricks apply.

Let's see how that works. The Schwarzschild metric in standard coordinates reads
$$ ds^2 = - f(r) dt^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2, $$
where
$$ f(r) = 1-\frac{2 M}{r}.$$
The metric is singular where $f(r)$ vanishes, at $r=2M$. This surface is special: it is the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), but the singularity is a coordinate artefact. The Schwarzschild case reduces to the Minkowski case when we switch to the tortoise coordinate
$$ r_\ast = \int \frac{dr}{f(r)} = r + 2 M \log (r-2M).$$
The metric becomes
$$ ds^2 = f(r(r_\ast)) (- dt^2 + dr_\ast^2) + r(r_\ast)^2 d\sigma^2. $$
Ignoring the angular part, the spacetime metric is just a conformal Minkowski metric in coordinates $(t,r_\ast)$ with in- and outgoing coordinates $t+r_\ast$ and $t-r_\ast$. For all practical purposes of a Penrose diagram, you can consider the Schwarzschild metric to be simply $ -dt^2 + dr_\ast^2$. The main difference is the domain of $r_\ast$. While the domain of $r$ in Minkowski is $[0,\infty)$, the domain of the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$ in Schwarzschild is $(-\infty, \infty)$. This difference is why the Minkowski conformal diagram looks like a triangle, whereas the conformal diagram for the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime is a diamond.
