### Highlights

- I constructed a solution to the outer boundary and the radiation extraction problems in numerical simulations of wave equations
- I pioneered the use of horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates in black hole perturbation theory by constructing general and suitable coordinates for hyperboloidal surfaces in black hole spacetimes ([2]), and performed the first numerical calculations with them ([3]). This approach is now commonly applied in the current literature and can be expected to have a lasting impact on black hole theory.
- Two papers that I published ([4]) as part of the Simulating-eXtreme-Spacetimes collaboration during my time at Caltech have been cited by the announcement of the Nobel prize winning direct detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger ([5]).
- My latest collaboration exploring the interior singularity of rotating black holes ([6]) was featured in various news outlets ([7]) in 2016.
