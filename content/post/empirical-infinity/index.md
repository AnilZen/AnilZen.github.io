I'm a physicist. Most of my research uses infinity in numerical computations. When presenting my work, I often encounter the objection that infinity is not physical. But not all infinities are created equal, and some are more physical than others. In fact, we can **experimentally verify** that we are at infinity with respect to distant sources of radiation.

Below I collect some thoughts on infinity and the relation between mathematical models and physical reality. You can skip my ramblings go directly to the [experiment](#a-thought-experiment).

### We don't need no infinity

Physicists are generally uncomfortable with infinity. First, it is argued, infinity cannot be the outcome of a physical experiment. Second, infinity as the outcome of a calculation indicates problems with the theory. Resolving such an infinity may initiate interesting research directions such as [renormalization techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization). Since infinity doesn't make sense in experiment and should be avoided in theory, physicists are skeptical when it appears in mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena (see, for example, Max Tegmark's argument that infinity is an idea that should be [retired from physics](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25344), or Nicolas Gisin who aims to [understand time](https://www.quantamagazine.org/does-time-really-flow-new-clues-come-from-a-century-old-approach-to-math-20200407/) without relying on infinitely precise numbers). This uneasiness of physicists with infinity is shared with some mathematicians as well, so there are mathematical philosophies and formalisms without infinity that physicists can rely on, such as [finitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism) or [intuitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism).

I was attracted to similar ideas when I was in college, so I went down the rabbit hole of [fuzzy numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_number). They seemed like a "natural" way to represent physical quantities which do not come as real numbers but as numbers with uncertainties. The more I learned about fuzzy numbers, the less I was convinced of their general utility. They seemed rather cumbersome and did not ease calculations in most cases. I learned, by way of fuzzy numbers, that successful mathematical representations do not necessarily match our physical intuitions. We should use the most powerful mathematical tools that give us the best quantitative description of our measurements. That's why we need to keep infinity around as I'll explain on a [Gedankenexperiment](#a-thought-experiment).

### Empirical infinity
Aristotle distinguishes [two notions of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_infinity): actual and potential. Potential infinity is what children learn first: numbers just keep going "forever". Actual infinity is the completion of this process: the set of all numbers as a mathematical object.

In natural experience, we do not observe infinity directly. But we can use it in representing our experience. For example, in projective geometry the point at which two parallel lines meet is infinitely far away. When you're painting, you may allow both sides of a road to meet on your canvas to indicate an endless road. We all know that the road ends somewhere but the painting suggests that the meeting point is beyond the horizon of perception. The mathematical representation for the idea of "far" on your canvas is infinity. 

I would argue that the infinity represented on your canvas is neither actual nor potential, but empirical. Empirical concepts are abstracted from individual perceptions. Infinity is the best canvas representation of your perception looking down a long road. You don't know how far you can see, and you do not care about representing that particular detail in your painting. You just want to express that it's very far. 

The thought experiment describes below confirms that we are at empirical infinity with respect to typical sources of strong gravitational waves.

### A thought experiment


The thought experiment relies on 

The thought experiment relies on the long-time decay of black hole perturbations. Surprisingly, the long-time decay rate of black hole perturbations is different at infinity and at a finite distance. This difference triggers an intriguing question. Which decay rate would a hypothetical observer measure? I argue that the observer will measure the rate for infinity, which is the sense in which I claim that we are at infinity with respect to sources of radiation.




Infinity doesn't exist in the real world as much as the number 1 doesn't exist in the real world.



Disagree with Ellis on: "We maintain that in each physical case where ∞ is used in a discussion, greater insight is attained by considering what large number N will suffice instead, because real physics is embodied in that number"
