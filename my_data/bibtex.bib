One set of modes that we call “zero-damping modes” has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit and exists for all corotating perturbations (ie modes with azimuthal index m≥ 0). The other set (the “damped modes”) retains a finite decay rate even for extremal Kerr black holes and exists only for a subset of corotating modes. As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value, the frequency spectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes are present.

The horizon-absorbed fluxes of a binary with a large mass ratio (q= 1000) obtained by numerical perturbative simulations are compared with an analytical, effective-one-body (EOB) resummed expression recently proposed. The perturbative method employs an analytical, linear in the mass ratio, EOB-resummed radiation reaction, and the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalism for wave extraction. Hyperboloidal layers are employed for the numerical solution of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations to accurately compute horizon fluxes up to the late plunge phase. The horizon fluxes from perturbative simulations and the EOB-resummed expression agree at the level of a few percent down to the late plunge.

Detection searches operate by matched filtering the detector data using a bank of waveform templates. Traditionally, template banks for BBHs are constructed from intermediary analytical waveform models which are calibrated against numerical relativity simulations and which can be evaluated for any choice of BBH parameters. This paper explores an alternative to the traditional approach, namely, the construction of template banks directly from numerical BBH simulations. Using nonspinning BBH systems as an example, we demonstrate which regions of the mass-parameter plane can be covered with existing numerical BBH waveforms.

  abstract    = {This thesis is concerned with the development and application of conformal techniques to numerical calculations of asymptotically flat spacetimes. The conformal compactification technique enables us to calculate spatially unbounded domains, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial timelike outer boundary. We construct in spherical symmetry an explicit scri-fixing gauge, ie a conformal and a coordinate gauge in which the spatial coordinate location of null infinity is independent of time so that no resolution loss in the physical part of the conformal extension appears. Going beyond spherical symmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity in the computational domain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems for the Einstein equations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To study spatial infinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general conformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the first numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution including spatial, null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the singularity. After developing a three dimensional, frame based evolution code with smooth inner and outer boundaries we calculate a radiative axisymmetric vacuum solution in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity represented as a cylinder including a piece of null infinity. In this context, a certain component of the rescaled Weyl tensor representing the radiation field is calculated unambiguously with respect to an adapted tetrad at null infinity.},

We analyze this problem using a recently developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations from a point particle in Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed radiation reaction force at linear order in the mass ratio ν≪ 1. Extending previous studies to nearly extremal negative spins, thus complementing current numerical relativity knowledge about the recoil, we find that the well-known decrease of the antikick is overturned …},

We show that a static solution with one unstable mode appears as an intermediate attractor in the evolution of initial data near a border between basins of attraction of two different vacuum states. We study the saddle-point dynamics near this attractor; in particular, we identify the universal phases of evolution: the ringdown approach, the exponential departure and the eventual decay to one of the vacuum states.},
