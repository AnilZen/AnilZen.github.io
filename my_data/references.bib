  abstract  = {We discuss the hyperboloidal evolution problem in general relativity from a numerical perspective, and present some new results. Families of initial data which are the hyperboloidal analogue of Brill waves are constructed numerically, and a systematic search for apparent horizons is performed. Schwarzschild‐Kruskal spacetime is discussed as a first application of Friedrich’s general conformal field equations in spherical symmetry, and the Maxwell equations are discussed on a nontrivial background as a toy model for continuum instabilities.}

This choice allows us to avoid the introduction of artificial timelike outer boundaries in numerical calculations. We construct manifestly stationary scri-fixing coordinates explicitly on Minkowski, Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.}
