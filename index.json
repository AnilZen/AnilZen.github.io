The swarm consists of agents, each is identified with a position, $\\mathbf{x}$, and mass, $m$. The key to their dynamics is communication: masses are being transferred from agents at high ground to low(-est) ground. At the same time, agents change positions with step size, $h=h(\\mathbf{x},m)$, adjusted to their relative mass: heavier agents proceed with small time-steps in the direction of local gradient, while lighter agents take larger time-steps based on a backtracking protocol. Accordingly, the crowd of agents is dynamically divided between \"heavier'' leaders, expected to approach local minima, and \"lighter'' explorers. With their large-step protocol, explorers are expected to encounter improved position for the swarm; if they do, then they assume the role of `heavy' swarm leaders and so on.

Often, qualitative diagrams are sufficient if you’re mainly interested in the essential causal relationships. But sometimes, for numerical work or for your own understanding, you need a quantitatively correct diagram.\nBelow, we draw Penrose diagrams using free and open-source software. We’ll draw the diagrams using the LaTeX package TikZ (not a drawing program but a program that draws2). We’ll use Python to perform transformations when we hit the computational limitations of TikZ.\nThe code for all diagrams below is on my website repository. The basic idea behind Penrose diagrams The Penrose diagram is an extension, or better, a completion of the Minkowski diagram. Like in the Minkowski diagram, time is vertical, space is horizontal, and null rays are at 45 degrees to the axes. In contrast to the Minkowski diagram, a Penrose diagram includes “points at infinity” added by compactification, thereby visualizing the rich structure of infinity arising from the unification of space and time.\nBelow are two beautiful TikZ diagrams by Izaak Neutelings. On the left is the Minkowski diagram. Spacetime extends infinitely in all directions. On the right is the Penrose diagram representing the entire spacetime in a finite square.\nMinkowski diagram Penrose Diagram Compactification maps the Minkowski diagram to the Penrose diagram by mapping the null directions to a finite interval. Let’s see how that works.\nMinkowski spacetime Consider the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with standard spherical coordinates: $t \\in (-\\infty,\\infty)$, $r \\in [0,\\infty)$, $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi]$, $\\varphi\\in[0,2\\pi)$ with metric $$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2, $$ where $d\\sigma^2=d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2$. Penrose diagrams are two-dimensional, so we essentially ignore the angular coordinates represented by the $d\\sigma^2$ piece. Each point on the diagram, except the line at the origin, represents a sphere. Spherical light rays propagate along the directions $t+r$ and $t-r$. These directions are called null because they are in the nullspace of the metric.\nUnderlying the Penrose diagrams are coordinates, $T$ and $R$, which compactify these null directions: $$ T+R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t-r). $$ The scale factor $2/\\pi$ is to map the range of the coordinates to $T\\pm R \\in(-1,1)$. Note that I’m not including the endpoints in the intervals yet. The Penrose compactification procedure involves the conformal completion of the spacetime, which adds the points at infinity after a regularizing rescaling. This detail is not relevant for the diagrams but is important for geometry.\nThe Penrose coordinates $(T,R)$ read in terms of the standard $(t,r)$ as: $$ T(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) + \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$ $$ R(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) - \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$\nLet’s make some plots using these coordinates. I’ll demonstrate plotting time surfaces (level sets of a time coordinate). Say you’d like to draw constant $t$ surfaces in the Penrose diagram. You might be tempted to solve the above relationships for a graph function $T(R;t)$ with constant $t$. But it is easier to let the machine do the work and plot the surfaces parametrically. Define the functions $T(t,r)$ and $R(t,r)$ in TikZ as follows:\n\\tikzset{declare function={ T(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) + atan(\\t-\\r))}; R(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) - atan(\\t-\\r))}; }} Then, plot the lines parametrically.\n\\def\\Nlines{6} % total number of lines is 2\\Nlines+1 \\newcommand\\samp[1]{ tan(90*#1) } % for equidistant sampling \\foreach \\i [evaluate={\\t=\\i/(\\Nlines+1);}] in {-\\Nlines,...,\\Nlines}{ \\message{Drawing i=\\i...^^J} \\draw[line width=0.3,samples=30,smooth,variable=\\r,domain=0.001:1] plot({ R(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }, { T(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }); } We’re sampling points fairly evenly by incorporating the compactification into the plot function. As you can see in the diagrams below, the time surfaces are equally separated from each other at the origin. The function samp controls the separation of points in the plot.\nCompactification with arctan (file) Compactification with tanh (file) The two versions of the diagram illustrate a coordinate-dependent feature that confuses even the experts. The $t$ surfaces intersect at spatial infinity, $i^0$, on both diagrams. On the left, they are tangent to each other, while on the right, they are not. So this seems to be a coordinate-dependent feature. Penrose used the inverse tangent function in his original papers. Many other choices exist. For example, using the hyperbolic tangent, the mapping reads $$ T+R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t-r). $$ This mapping gives the diagram on the right where $t$ surfaces are not tangential at spatial infinity. There’s a subtlety here. …","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"b1b51da98855313b12125eee70e01c8b","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/post/2022/drawing-penrose-diagrams/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022/drawing-penrose-diagrams/","section":"post","summary":"This is the first installment of a three-piece series on Penrose diagrams and the associated conformal compactification procedure.

This method perturbatively expands the metric of the binary in powers of the mass ratio. The source for the perturbations depends on the orbital configuration, calculational approach, and the order of the perturbative expansion. These sources fall into three broad classes: (i) distributional, (ii) worldtube, and (iii) unbounded support. The latter, in particular, is important for emerging second-order (in the mass ratio) calculations. Traditional frequency domain approaches employ the variation of parameters method and compute the perturbation on standard time slices with numerical boundary conditions supplied at finite radius from series expansions of the asymptotic behavior. This approach has been very successful, but the boundary conditions calculations are tedious, and the approach is not well suited to unbounded sources where homogeneous solutions must be computed at all radii. This work develops an alternative approach where hyperboloidal slices foliate the spacetime, and compactifying coordinates simplify the boundary treatment. We implement this approach with a multi-domain spectral solver with analytic mesh refinement and use the scalar-field self-force on circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole as an example problem. The method works efficiently for all three source classes encountered in self-force calculations and has distinct advantages over the traditional approach. For example, our code efficiently computes the perturbation for orbits with extremely large orbital radii ($r_p\u003e10^5 M$) or modes with very high spherical harmonic mode index ($\\ell \\geq 100$). Our results indicate that hyperboloidal methods can play an essential role in self-force calculations.

Physicists are jealous of these fish drawn by M.C. Escher.

Escher was interested in constructing an infinitely repeating pattern in a finite figure. When the brilliant geometer Coxeter shared with him a reprint of one of his lectures on hyperbolic geometry, Escher figured out how to create such tessalations. The story of how Escher managed to create these four woodcuts is fascinating.\nThe original Quanta article in the tweet above reports the difficulties in constructing something like the AdS/CFT correspondence for physical spacetimes. While we have a realization of holographic duality based on anti-de Sitter spacetimes, a similar construction on flat or de Sitter spacetimes has been elusive, supposedly because these spacetimes do not possess hyperbolic geometry. A week after the tweet above, there was another Quanta article with hyperbolic geometry as its featured image. Clearly, there is some hype around hyperbolic geometry.\nThe main argument is that spatial slices of AdS are hyperbolic, which seems to be essential for AdS/CFT, so living in hyperbolic geometry makes it easier for the fish in Escher’s drawing to know quantum gravity.\nThe fish doesn’t think because the fish knows everything.\nKusturica (1993) from the movie Arizona Dream\nWe are, however, not like those fish; we want to discover quantum gravity. The obstacle remains that our physical models for spacetime are either asymptotically flat (for isolated systems) or de Sitter (for cosmology).\nI argue below that there is no need to be jealous of the fish. We do live in hyperbolic geometry; we just don’t know it yet.\nThere are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”\nWallace (2005) from his commencement speech This Is Water.\nLittle fish, big fish Let’s start with a short review of the hyperbolic fish in Escher’s drawing. Hyperbolic geometry is typically introduced in a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space using the equation for a hyperboloid in Cartesian coordinates. I’ll be using spherical coordinates foreshadowing an application below, so we have the Minkowski space with line element $$ ds^2_{\\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2,$$ where $d\\sigma^2=d\\sigma^2+\\sin^2\\theta \\ d\\varphi^2$, the usual metric on the unit sphere.\nSpheres and hyperboloids may seem very different, but they are analogous to each other. Just like the unit sphere is the set of points at unit Euclidean distance from the origin, the unit hyperboloid is the set of points at unit Minkowski distance from the origin: the hyperboloid is simply a (pseudo)sphere of Minkowski space $$t^2-r^2=1. \\tag{1} \\label{1}$$\nWe already have the first hint that we live in hyperbolic geometry! The hyperboloid describes the kinematic space of special relativity. But this was rather anticlimactic so let’s go a bit further.\nWe can derive and represent the intrinsic metric of hyperbolic geometry in various equivalent ways. For example, setting $t=\\cosh \\xi$ and $r=\\sinh \\xi$ satisfies the equation for the hyperboloid (\\ref{1}) identically, and gives us the hyperbolic line element $$ ds^2_{\\mathbb{H}^3} = d\\xi^2+ \\sinh^2\\xi \\ d\\sigma^2.$$ Note the similarity of this hyperbolic metric with the metric on the unit sphere. Coordinates are labels and it’s helpful to see hyperbolic geometry in different representations. Instead of introducing hyperbolic functions, let’s solve (\\ref{1}) directly $$ t = \\sqrt{1+r^2}. \\tag{2} \\label{2} $$ Replacing the $dt$ term with the differential of this relation in the Minkowski metric, we get $$ ds^2_{\\mathbb{H}^3} = \\textcolor{purple}{\\frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2}. \\tag{3} \\label{3} $$\nTo get Escher’s image of a disk, we need to map the hyperboloid model with its infinite range in $r$ to the unit Poincaré disk model. We relabel the radial points using $$ r = \\frac{2\\rho}{1-\\rho^2}, \\tag{4}\\label{4}$$ and obtain the familiar line element for the Poincaré ball1 $$ ds^2_{\\mathbb{H}^3} = \\textcolor{darkorange}{\\frac{4}{(1-\\rho^2)^2}\\left( d\\rho^2 + \\rho^2 d\\sigma^2 \\right)}. $$ The metric blows up near the boundary, which is how Escher packs the infinitely many fish in a repeating pattern into the disk.

To me, the recognition that natural laws dynamically govern space and time was a triumph of physics over philosophy, of Einstein over Kant, of empirical determination over synthetic a priori.\nAs fascinated as I was by special relativity, the formalism seemed relatively obscure. I recognized patterns in the Lorentz transformations but missed a deeper insight into the origins of this structure. At college, I considered various standard derivations of relativistic effects, such as the relativistic aberration or the Thomas precession, tedious and boring.\nA simple example is Einstein’s velocity-addition formula. In Galilean relativity, which corresponds to our everyday experience, we can just add velocities. In special relativity, the speed of light is constant, so the addition of velocities must be such that no composition of velocities exceeds the speed of light. In the simplest case of collinear motion (velocities pointing in the same direction), velocity addition becomes speed addition and looks like this $$ \\tag{1} \\label{1} u = \\frac{u_1+u_2}{1+\\tfrac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}} $$ The speed of light, $c$, can never be exceeded with this composition law. While we can understand the result, it is not intuitively clear how this addition rule is related to the structure of space and time.\nIt turns out that relativistic calculations have natural interpretations in hyperbolic geometry. This viewpoint not only simplifies the calculations but also provides deeper insights into the theory. Its power extends beyond special relativity into machine learning and general relativity. And it all starts with Minkowski.\nHyperbole In 1908, Minkowski gave a lecture about a new mathematical model for space and time. In his opening remarks, he stated boldly that, from now on, space and time are mere shadows of a more fundamental union: spacetime.\nHenceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.\nMinkowski (1908)1\nThe quote is by now famous. It has made its way to various outlets since appearing on the cover page of Synge’s textbook on relativity in 1956. But when Minkowski made the statement, it was considered hyperbole and encountered resistance from physicists and mathematicians alike.2\nThe spacetime view became widely celebrated a few years after the lecture because of its central role in general relativity. In the same lecture, Minkowski also promoted a non-Euclidean approach to spacetime. As a Göttingen mathematics professor, he recognized the non-Euclidean geometry of special relativity. This idea, however, didn’t gain traction as widely as the idea of spacetime. Only in the last 20 years has there been renewed interest in the hyperbolic nature of special relativity.\nTo see why hyperbolic geometry is the natural geometry for special relativity, consider a two-dimensional spacetime with coordinates $(t,x)$ and Minkowski metric $$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2. $$ A natural object for a metric is the set of points at unit distance from the origin. In two-dimensional Euclidean space, we get a circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. In two-dimensional Minkowski space, we get a hyperbola\n$$ \\tag{2}\\label{2} t^2 - x^2 = 1. $$ Minkowski’s drawing below shows this hyperbola for $t\u0026gt;0$. In higher dimensions, you get the one-sheeted hyperboloid, also called hyperbolic hyperboloid.\nMinkowski’s drawing depicts hyperbola as the invariant space under Lorentz transformations. From Minkowski’s modern world by Scott Walter. In his lecture, Minkowski demonstrated that Lorentz transformations are hyperbolic rotations that leave the hyperbola (\\ref{2}) invariant. He died in January 1909 before he could develop this idea further, but it was embraced by a few other scientists, particularly by Sommerfeld, Varičak, Robb, and Borel.\nThe principle of relativity corresponds to the hypothesis that the kinematic space is a space of constant negative curvature, the space of Lobachevsky and Bolyai. The value of the radius of curvature is the speed of light.\nBorel (1913)\nThe mathematical formalism for a hyperbolic rotation is just like a regular rotation, except with hyperbolic functions instead of trigonometric functions. Hyperbolic functions are related to their trigonometric counterparts through complex angles. An intuitive way to think about the hyperbolic rotation is the squeeze mapping, which should be familiar to anyone who has seen a Lorentz transformation on a spacetime diagram.\nLorentz boosts are squeeze mappings.

Consider the Lorentz boost with relative speed $v$ between frames $$ L(v)= \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma \u0026amp; -\\gamma \\beta \\\\ -\\gamma \\beta \u0026amp; \\gamma \\end{pmatrix}, $$ where we defined the rescaled speed $\\beta:=\\tfrac{v}{c}$ and the Lorentz factor $\\gamma:=1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$.

To understand spacetime then, consider black holes.\nThe black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.\nChandrasekhar (1983)\nBlack holes are simple with just two properties: mass and rotation. By dropping an object into a black hole, you can increase its mass and change its rotation.\nThe simplicity of black holes contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, which states that total entropy never decreases. If black holes are that simple, you can reduce total entropy by dropping a high-entropy object, say a hot teacup, into the black hole.\nWheeler, best known for coining the term “black hole,” tasked one of his graduate students at Princeton, the young Bekenstein, with resolving this paradox. The golden age of relativity was in full swing around 1970, and Princeton was among the best places to be. Christodoulou, another student of Wheeler, and Hawking had just shown that the area of a black hole horizon never decreases. To resolve the entropy paradox, Bekenstein conjectured that black holes must have entropy and that the entropy must be proportional to the area of the black hole horizon in Planck units. The proportionality constant was determined by the discovery of Hawking temperature, which is why we call it the Bekenstein-Hawking Black-Hole entropy $$ S_{BH} = \\frac{A}{4 L_P^2}$$ where $A$ is the horizon area, $L_P$ is the Planck length, $S$ stands for entropy (probably after Sadi Carnot), and BH stands for Brief History.\nYou may think this is a curious result about curious objects called black holes with little relevance to our notion of spacetime. But consider the following question: what is the maximum entropy in a finite, say spherical region? If you take some high-entropy matter and squeeze it spherically (with your mind), eventually, you hit the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the compressed matter forms a black hole. This thought experiment leads to the surprising conclusion that the entropy of any matter system is bound by the surface area of the smallest sphere that encloses it1.\nWe started with black holes and arrived at the\nHolographic Principle Counterintuitively, the maximal entropy of a region scales with the area of its boundary, not its volume. The holographic principle pushes this area-dependence further, suggesting that the dynamics in a volume of space is encoded on the boundary of that space. In other words, the information content of a spacetime region is encoded on the surface of that region.\nTake a break and think about this for a moment. How can our three-dimensional world be encoded on a two-dimensional surface? What does it mean? Is the universe a game running on the screen of an alien child? Are we trapped in The Matrix? Are we Livin’ on the Edge?\nAerosmith: Livin’ on the Edge (Video 1993) AdS/CFT correspondence The most famous realization of the holographic principle is the AdS/CFT correspondence. Conjectured by Maldacena in 1997, the correspondence suggests an equivalence between a string theory in curved anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS) and a strongly coupled conformal field theory in a lower-dimensional flat spacetime. Aside from the details, the remarkable aspect of the conjecture is the duality between the bulk and the boundary of AdS.\nBelow is a visual image for the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. The cylinder represents the three-dimensional AdS$_3$ spacetime. On the boundary of the cylinder lives the 1+1 dimensional CFT$_2$. Slices of constant time are hyperbolic manifolds with negative curvature, drawn as Poincaré disks. A gravity theory within the disks is dual to a gravity-free theory on the bounding circle. The boundary of space encodes the bulk.\nAdS is hyperbolic space with a time direction. Wikimedia The negative curvature of AdS is a feature and a bug. It allows the realization of the holographic principle due to its hyperbolic slices, but it also makes AdS an unphysical model for our universe. At cosmological scales, the universe has positive curvature and resembles de Sitter space. At astrophysical and smaller scales, isolated systems are modeled by asymptotically flat spacetimes. Either way, anti-de Sitter spacetime, with all its bizarre features, is not a good model for physical reality.\nCan we establish the holographic principle for isolated systems?\nHyperbolic Hyperboloidal Consider the AdS$_3$ metric in static coordinates with curvature scale $L$ $$ ds^2_{\\rm{AdS}} = - \\left(L^2+r^2\\right) d\\tau^2 + \\textcolor{RedViolet}{\\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2},$$ Slices of constant time are hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature.

When presenting my work, I often encounter the objection that infinity is not physical. But not all infinities are created equal, and some are more physical than others.

Feel free to skip my ramblings and go directly to the experiment.\nWe don’t need no infinity Physicists are generally uncomfortable with infinity. First, it is argued, infinity cannot be the outcome of a physical experiment. Second, infinity as the outcome of a calculation indicates problems with the theory. Resolving such problems is important because they may reveal new research directions such as renormalization techniques. Since infinity doesn’t make sense in experiment and should be avoided in theory, physicists are skeptical when it appears in mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena. A few examples: Max Tegmark argues that infinity is an idea that should be retired from physics; Nicolas Gisin aims to understand time without relying on infinitely precise numbers; and here is a quote from The physics of infinity by Ellis, Meissner, and Nicolai:\nWe maintain that in each physical case where $\\infty$ is used in a discussion, greater insight is attained by considering what large number $N$ will suffice instead because real physics is embodied in that number.\nThis uneasiness of physicists with infinity is also present in mathematics. There are mathematical philosophies and formalisms without infinity, such as finitism or intuitionism.

They seemed to “naturally” represent physical measurements, which are not real numbers with infinite precision but fuzzy numbers with uncertainties. The more I learned about fuzzy numbers, however, the less I was convinced of their general utility. They were cumbersome and did not improve calculations in most cases. I learned, by way of fuzzy numbers, that successful mathematical representations do not necessarily match our physical intuitions. The map is not the territory.\nEmpirical infinity Aristotle distinguishes two notions of infinity: actual and potential. Potential infinity is what children learn first: numbers just keep going “forever”. Actual infinity is the completion of this process: the set of all numbers as a mathematical object.\nWe do not observe infinity directly but we use it to represent our impressions of the natural world. In a painting, both sides of a road may meet at a vanishing point. The road ends somewhere but the painting suggests that the meeting point is beyond the horizon of perception. The representation of “far” on the canvas is infinity.\nThe infinity on the canvas is neither potential (it’s a finite, completed representation of infinity) nor actual (the horizon is actually at a finite distance). Call it empirical infinity. Empirical concepts are abstracted from individual perceptions. Empirical infinity is the best canvas representation of your perception looking down a long, seemingly unending road. You don’t know how far you can see, and you don’t care about representing that particular detail in your painting. You just want to express that it’s very far.\nA thought experiment Black hole perturbations have a property that is different at infinity and at a finite distance. We can use this property to determine where we are with respect to the black hole. We would need very accurate detectors to measure it, which we don’t have yet, so consider this a reasonable thought experiment.\nPerturbations of a black hole go through an oscillatory period, and subsequently decay with a power-law $ \\sim t^p$, where $t$ is time as measured by the observer and $p$ is the negative power1. Surprisingly, the power $p$ is different depending on where you observe the perturbations: -3 at finite distances, -2 at infinity2. The slower decay at infinity is somewhat unexpected. One could argue that the power-law decay, which was first discovered for finite distances, should be non-radiative; it shouldn’t even be detected at infinity. As demonstrated by Gundlach, Price, and Pullin in 1994, it is not only radiative but decays slower at infinity than at finite distances3. There are explanations of this slower decay in terms of accumulation of backscattering off of curvature towards infinity, but this is not our main concern4. Given that the rates at finite distances and infinity are different, we ask the following question:\nWhich decay rate would we observe?\nWe are clearly a finite distance away from the black hole, so the intuitive answer is that we would measure the finite distance rate. However, the correct answer is the infinity rate.\nBelow is a figure from a paper of mine where I studied various decay rates. The figure shows the evolution of the decay rate in …","date":1631059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631059200,"objectID":"30c89054cbc480356b657f639ddac8e7","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/post/empirical-infinity/","publishdate":"2021-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/empirical-infinity/","section":"post","summary":"Infinity may be closer than you think.","tags":["infinity"],"title":"How far is infinity?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Lior Burko","Gaurav Khanna","Anıl Zenginoğlu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1454976e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621996395,"objectID":"9605cd72ea8dabae1a8760ed9da28db2","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/publication/burko-2016-cauchy/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T02:33:15.431181Z","relpermalink":"/publication/burko-2016-cauchy/","section":"publication","summary":"The Cauchy horizon inside a perturbed Kerr black hole develops an instability that transforms it into a curvature singularity.

Perturbative analyses are consistent with the picture arising from fully nonlinear simulations of spherical charged black holes: this singularity is deformational weak and null for early retarded times.

Here, we report on preliminary results obtained from a linear simulation of the evolution of the fields under the collapse of a test wave packet.

For certain merger configurations the time evolution of the magnitude of the kick velocity has a local maximum followed by a sudden drop. Perturbative studies of this “antikick” in a limited range of black hole spins have found that the antikick decreases for retrograde orbits as a function of negative spin. We analyze this problem using a recently developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations from a point particle in Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed radiation reaction force at linear order in the mass ratio $ν≪1$. Extending previous studies to nearly extremal negative spins, thus complementing current numerical relativity knowledge about the recoil, we find that the well-known decrease of the antikick is overturned and, instead of approaching zero, the antikick increases again to reach $Δv/(cν^2)=3.37×10^{−3}$ for dimensionless spin $\\hat{a}=−0.9999$. The corresponding final kick velocity is $v_{end}/(cν^2)=0.076$. We interpret the antikick result analytically by means of the quality factor $Q$ of the linear momentum flux, that is used to quantify the amount of nonadiabaticity of the emission process. We show that, besides capturing qualitatively the global properties over the whole spin range, $Q$ actually predicts the return of the antikick for $\\hat{a}\\to−1$. Since $Q$ is computed only from the, gauge-invariant, flux of linear momentum, the herein presented verification of its reliability advocates its systematic use also in numerical relativity calculations. In addition, we also connect, in a new way, the properties of the flux to the noncircular character of the plunge dynamics, highlighting the central role of subdominant waveform multipoles in shaping the characteristic interference pattern exhibited by the linear momentum flux as $\\hat{a}\\to−1$.","tags":[],"title":"The antikick strikes back: Recoil velocities for nearly extremal binary black hole mergers in the test-mass limit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Donninger","Anıl Zenginoğlu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1401408e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621996396,"objectID":"7a7cf62f984ecd3853b2a9de0fe05dde","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/publication/donninger-2014-nondispersive/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T02:33:16.654879Z","relpermalink":"/publication/donninger-2014-nondispersive/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the hyperboloidal initial value problem for the cubic focusing wave equation $$ (-\\partial_t^2+\\Delta_x)v(t,x)+v(t,x)^3=0,\\quad x\\in \\mathbb{R}^3. $$ Without symmetry assumptions, we prove the existence of a co-dimension 4 Lipschitz manifold of initial data that lead to global solutions in forward time which do not scatter to free waves.

One set of modes that we call “zero-damping modes” has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit and exists for all corotating perturbations (ie modes with azimuthal index m≥ 0).

We present the first numerical approximation of the scalar Schwarzschild Green function in the time domain, which reveals several universal features of wave propagation in black hole spacetimes. We demonstrate the trapping of energy near the photon sphere and confirm its exponential decay. The trapped wavefront passes through caustics resulting in echoes that propagate to infinity. The arrival times and the decay rate of these caustic echoes are consistent with propagation along null geodesics and the large $\\ell$ limit of quasinormal modes. We show that the fourfold singularity structure of the retarded Green function is due to the well-known action of a Hilbert transform on the trapped wavefront at caustics. A twofold cycle is obtained for degenerate source-observer configurations along the caustic line, where the energy amplification increases with an inverse power of the scale of the source. Finally, we discuss the tail piece of the solution due to propagation within the light cone, up to and including null infinity, and argue that, even with ideal instruments, only a finite number of echoes can be observed. Putting these pieces together, we provide a heuristic expression that approximates the Green function with a few free parameters. Accurate calculations and approximations of the Green function are the most general way of solving for wave propagation in curved spacetimes and should be useful in a variety of studies such as the computation of the self-force on a particle.","tags":[],"title":"Caustic echoes from a Schwarzschild black hole","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastiano Bernuzzi","Alessandro Nagar","Anıl Zenginoğlu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621996394,"objectID":"2f59c82591cfe2db4748d89bbc4469f8","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/publication/bernuzzi-2012-horizon/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T02:33:14.816039Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bernuzzi-2012-horizon/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the horizon absorption of gravitational waves in coalescing, circularized, nonspinning black-hole binaries.
