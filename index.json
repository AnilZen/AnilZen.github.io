Below I explain these words in reverse order: infinity, light, follow.\nInfinity  Mathematics is the science of the infinite.\nHermann Weyl (1930)  You must have some familiarity with infinity if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this. Most of us think of the in-finite as that which does not end. There are many approaches to this intriguing notion and if you go down the rabbit hole, Weyl\u0026rsquo;s seemingly presumptuous assessment above starts making more sense. Infinity is everywhere in mathematics. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve wondered how space could end (what\u0026rsquo;s on the other side of the end?), or thought about Achilles overtaking the tortoise while you were racing your friends, or explained someone how you can fit infinitely many people infinitely many times into Hilbert\u0026rsquo;s Hotel.\nBut why would a physicist study it? All examples above are clearly mathematical constructs. Racers do overtake each other, and if a hotel is full you have to go find another one. After all, there is nothing truly infinite in the physical world.\nInfinity in physics is an excellent idealization in many circumstances. It is important here to make a distinction between idealization and approximation. Our best physical theories are idealizations of the natural world. Given the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences, it is important to keep these idealizations in tact, instead of breaking them in approximations.\nThe infinitely far is an idealization of a very large distance. Just like the real numbers are more convenient than fuzzy numbers, the infinitely far is more convenient than some arbitrary large distance.\nLight  Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.\nHermann Minkowski (1908)  Follow Highlights  I pioneered the use of horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates in black hole perturbation theory [1], [2] and performed the first numerical computations with such coordinates [3], [4], [5]. I developed a practical method that solves the outer boundary problem and the radiation extraction problem in numerical calculations of wave equations [6]. Together with Chad Galley, I computed the first global approximation of a black hole Green function in the time domain and explained the shape of caustic echoes from black holes by an optical effect discovered in 1890 [7]. Together with Gaurav Khanna, I computed the first gravitational waves at null infinity on the background of a rotating black hole demonstrating an efficiency gain of at least 5000 in one simulation [8]. Two of my papers published as part of the Simulating-eXtreme-Spacetimes Collaboration have been cited by the first detection of gravitational waves which led to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics [9], [10].

Perturbative analyses are consistent with the picture arising from fully nonlinear simulations of spherical charged black holes: this singularity is deformational weak and null for early retarded times. Despite much interest in this long-standing problem, no numerical simulations of the interior of a perturbed Kerr black hole have been done to date. Here, we report on preliminary results obtained from a linear simulation of the evolution of the fields under the collapse of a test wave packet. We use recent developments to a Teukolsky equation solver, which use (event) horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates, which compactify null infinity and penetrate through both horizons. This numerical technology allows us to penetrate through the event horizon, and probe the fields on the approach to the Cauchy horizon singularity. We study the behavior of the Weyl scalars $ψ_0$ and $ψ_4$ and of the curvature scalar $R_{αβγδ}R^{αβγδ}$, and confront our results with those of perturbation analysis.

For certain merger configurations the time evolution of the magnitude of the kick velocity has a local maximum followed by a sudden drop. Perturbative studies of this “antikick” in a limited range of black hole spins have found that the antikick decreases for retrograde orbits as a function of negative spin. We analyze this problem using a recently developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations from a point particle in Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed radiation reaction force at linear order in the mass ratio $ν≪1$. Extending previous studies to nearly extremal negative spins, thus complementing current numerical relativity knowledge about the recoil, we find that the well-known decrease of the antikick is overturned and, instead of approaching zero, the antikick increases again to reach $Δv/(cν^2)=3.37×10^{−3}$ for dimensionless spin $\\hat{a}=−0.9999$. The corresponding final kick velocity is $v_{end}/(cν^2)=0.076$. We interpret the antikick result analytically by means of the quality factor $Q$ of the linear momentum flux, that is used to quantify the amount of nonadiabaticity of the emission process. We show that, besides capturing qualitatively the global properties over the whole spin range, $Q$ actually predicts the return of the antikick for $\\hat{a}\\to−1$. Since $Q$ is computed only from the, gauge-invariant, flux of linear momentum, the herein presented verification of its reliability advocates its systematic use also in numerical relativity calculations. In addition, we also connect, in a new way, the properties of the flux to the noncircular character of the plunge dynamics, highlighting the central role of subdominant waveform multipoles in shaping the characteristic interference pattern exhibited by the linear momentum flux as $\\hat{a}\\to−1$.","tags":[],"title":"The antikick strikes back: Recoil velocities for nearly extremal binary black hole mergers in the test-mass limit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Donninger","Anıl Zenginoğlu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1401408e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621996396,"objectID":"7a7cf62f984ecd3853b2a9de0fe05dde","permalink":"/publication/donninger-2014-nondispersive/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T02:33:16.654879Z","relpermalink":"/publication/donninger-2014-nondispersive/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the hyperboloidal initial value problem for the cubic focusing wave equation $$ (-\\partial_t^2+\\Delta_x)v(t,x)+v(t,x)^3=0,\\quad x\\in \\mathbb{R}^3. $$ Without symmetry assumptions, we prove the existence of a co-dimension 4 Lipschitz manifold of initial data that lead to global solutions in forward time which do not scatter to free waves.

Detection searches operate by matched filtering the detector data using a bank of waveform templates. Traditionally, template banks for BBHs are constructed from intermediary analytical waveform models which are calibrated against numerical relativity simulations and which can be evaluated for any choice of BBH parameters. This paper explores an alternative to the traditional approach, namely, the construction of template banks directly from numerical BBH simulations. Using nonspinning BBH systems as an example, we demonstrate which regions of the mass-parameter plane can be covered with existing numerical BBH waveforms.

The arrival times and the decay rate of these caustic echoes are consistent with propagation along null geodesics and the large $\\ell$ limit of quasinormal modes. We show that the fourfold singularity structure of the retarded Green function is due to the well-known action of a Hilbert transform on the trapped wavefront at caustics. A twofold cycle is obtained for degenerate source-observer configurations along the caustic line, where the energy amplification increases with an inverse power of the scale of the source. Finally, we discuss the tail piece of the solution due to propagation within the light cone, up to and including null infinity, and argue that, even with ideal instruments, only a finite number of echoes can be observed. Putting these pieces together, we provide a heuristic expression that approximates the Green function with a few free parameters.

It is shown that a conformal scale factor can be freely prescribed a priori in terms of coordinates in a well-posed hyperboloidal initial value problem such that the location of null infinity is independent of the time coordinate. With an appropriate choice of a single gauge source function each of the formally singular conformal source terms in the equations attains a regular limit at null infinity.

The conformal compactification technique enables us to calculate spatially unbounded domains, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial timelike outer boundary. We construct in spherical symmetry an explicit scri-fixing gauge, ie a conformal and a coordinate gauge in which the spatial coordinate location of null infinity is independent of time so that no resolution loss in the physical part of the conformal extension appears. Going beyond spherical symmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity in the computational domain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems for the Einstein equations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To study spatial infinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general conformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the first numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution including spatial, null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the singularity. After developing a three dimensional, frame based evolution code with smooth inner and outer boundaries we calculate a radiative axisymmetric vacuum solution in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity represented as a cylinder including a piece of null infinity. In this context, a certain component of the rescaled Weyl tensor representing the radiation field is calculated unambiguously with respect to an adapted tetrad at null infinity.","tags":[],"title":"A conformal approach to numerical calculations of asymptotically flat spacetimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anıl Zenginoğlu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621996397,"objectID":"7c12785323dc8022e27b44b7d2ad9f20","permalink":"/publication/zenginoglu-2007-numerical/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T02:33:17.066226Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zenginoglu-2007-numerical/","section":"publication","summary":"After describing in short some problems and methods regarding the smoothness of null infinity for isolated systems, I present numerical calculations in which both spatial and null infinity can be studied.
