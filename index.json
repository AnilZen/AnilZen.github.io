To understand spacetime then, consider black holes.\n The black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.\nChandrasekhar (1983)\n Black holes are simple with just two properties: mass and rotation. By dropping an object into a black hole, you can increase its mass and change its rotation.\nThe simplicity of black holes contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, which states that total entropy never decreases. If black holes are that simple, you can reduce total entropy by dropping a high-entropy object, say a hot teacup, into the black hole.\nWheeler, best known for coining the term \u0026ldquo;black hole,\u0026rdquo; tasked one of his graduate students at Princeton, the young Bekenstein, with resolving this paradox. The golden age of relativity was in full swing around 1970, and Princeton was among the best places to be. Christodoulou, another student of Wheeler, and Hawking had just shown that the area of a black hole horizon never decreases. To resolve the entropy paradox, Bekenstein conjectured that black holes must have entropy and that the entropy must be proportional to the area of the black hole horizon in Planck units. The proportionality constant was determined by the discovery of Hawking temperature, which is why we call it the Bekenstein-Hawking Black-Hole entropy $$ S_{BH} = \\frac{A}{4 L_P^2}$$ where $A$ is the horizon area, $L_P$ is the Planck length, $S$ stands for entropy (probably after Sadi Carnot), and BH stands for Brief History.\nYou may think this is a curious result about curious objects called black holes with little relevance to our notion of spacetime. But consider the following question: what is the maximum entropy in a finite, say spherical region? If you take some high-entropy matter and squeeze it spherically (with your mind), eventually, you hit the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the compressed matter forms a black hole. This thought experiment leads to the surprising conclusion that the entropy of any matter system is bound by the surface area of the smallest sphere that encloses it1.\nWe started with black holes and arrived at the\nHolographic Principle Counterintuitively, the maximal entropy of a region scales with the area of its boundary, not its volume. The holographic principle pushes this area-dependence further, suggesting that the dynamics in a volume of space is encoded on the boundary of that space. In other words, the information content of a spacetime region is encoded on the surface of that region.\nTake a break and think about this for a moment. How can our three-dimensional world be encoded on a two-dimensional surface? What does it mean? Is the universe a game running on the screen of an alien child? Are we trapped in The Matrix? Are we Livin' on the Edge?\n   Aerosmith: Livin' on the Edge (Video 1993)  AdS/CFT correspondence The most famous realization of the holographic principle is the AdS/CFT correspondence. Conjectured by Maldacena in 1997, the correspondence suggests an equivalence between a string theory in curved anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS) and a strongly coupled conformal field theory in a lower-dimensional flat spacetime. Aside from the details, the remarkable aspect of the conjecture is the duality between the bulk and the boundary of AdS.\nBelow is a visual image for the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. The cylinder represents the three-dimensional AdS$_3$ spacetime. On the boundary of the cylinder lives the 1+1 dimensional CFT$_2$. Slices of constant time are hyperbolic manifolds with negative curvature, drawn as Poincaré disks. A gravity theory within the disks is dual to a gravity-free theory on the bounding circle. The boundary of space encodes the bulk.\n   AdS is hyperbolic space with a time direction. Wikimedia  The negative curvature of AdS is a feature and a bug. It allows the realization of the holographic principle due to its hyperbolic slices, but it also makes AdS an unphysical model for our universe. At cosmological scales, the universe has positive curvature and resembles de Sitter space. At astrophysical and smaller scales, isolated systems are modeled by asymptotically flat spacetimes. Either way, anti-de Sitter spacetime, with all its bizarre features, is not a good model for physical reality.\nCan we establish the holographic principle for isolated systems?\nHyperbolic Hyperboloidal Consider the AdS$_3$ metric in static coordinates with curvature scale $L$ $$ ds^2_{\\rm{AdS}} = - \\left(L^2+r^2\\right) d\\tau^2 + \\textcolor{RedViolet}{\\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2},$$ Slices of constant time are hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature. Hyperbolic geometry has much more space near its conformal boundary than Euclidean space. It seems that flat spacetime with its Euclidean time slices and vanishing curvature would not allow such a description $$ ds^2_{\\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 . $$\nBut now consider the time-shifted spacetime hyperboloid with curvature radius $L$ $$ (\\tau-t)^2 - r^2 = L^2 $$ This hypersurface is spacelike everywhere and extends to null infinity. Such surfaces are called hyperboloidal. Solving for $\\tau$, we choose the negative square root, so the surfaces extend to future null infinity. $$ \\tau = t - \\sqrt{L^2+r^2}.$$ In this hyperboloidal time, Minkowski metric has hyperbolic spatial slices $$ ds^2_{\\rm{Mink}} = -d\\tau^2 - \\frac{2 r}{\\sqrt{L^2+r^2}} d\\tau dr + \\textcolor{RedViolet}{\\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2}. $$ Just like AdS, flat spacetime takes the form of hyperbolic space with a time direction. You can draw the spacetime geometry as a cylinder, which is what Penrose did in his first publication on conformal infinity in 1963.\n   The cylinders in Penrose\u0026rsquo;s drawing are hyperbolic spaces with a time direction. Penrose, PRL (1963)  The agreement of the geometry of hyperboloidal and AdS slices is suggestive. Calculations in the AdS/CFT literature performed on time slices may carry over to flat spacetime in hyperboloidal coordinates. One such example is the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture.\nRT if you agree Ryu and Takayanagi (RT) have proposed a relation between geometry in AdS and entropy in CFT.\nOne can interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as a measure of information lost to external observers. The black-hole horizon acts as a screen dividing space into two subsystems inside and outside the horizon. Entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of this screen. The RT conjecture relates the entanglement entropy on CFT to the surface area of a screen in AdS that divides the AdS boundary into subdomains.\nWords don\u0026rsquo;t do it justice, so let\u0026rsquo;s look at a picture. Below is a diagram from the RT paper for AdS$_3$ /CFT$_2$.\n   Diagram demonstrating RT proposal on AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. Ryu and Takayanagi, arXiv (2006)  The two subsystems $A$ and $B$ of CFT$_2$ live on the boundary of AdS$_3$. They are separated by a screen $\\gamma_A$ required to be an extremal surface in the bulk AdS$_3$. An extremal \u0026ldquo;surface\u0026rdquo; on a slice of AdS$_3$ is a geodesic line connecting the meeting points of the domains $A$ and $B$ on the bounding circle. The RT proposal states that the entanglement entropy of subsystem $A$ is proportional to the area of the screen $\\gamma_A$: $$ S_A \\sim \\rm{Area\\ of\\ }\\gamma_A $$ In this case, we are talking about the length of a geodesic on a time slice. You can easily see that the calculation does not change whether you are in AdS or hyperboloidal Minkowski. In the example on Wikipedia, the AdS$_3$ metric is written in the spatial coordinate $\\rho$ defined through $r=\\sinh \\rho$, so $$ ds^2_{\\rm{AdS}} = -\\cosh^2\\rho\\ d\\tau^2 + \\textcolor{Blue}{d\\rho^2 + \\sinh^2\\rho\\ d\\theta^2}. $$ The same spatial geometry is obtained in hyperboloidal coordinates in Minkowski2 $$ ds^2_{\\rm{Mink}} = -d\\tau^2 - \\sinh\\rho\\ d\\tau d\\rho + \\textcolor{Blue}{d\\rho^2 + \\sinh^2\\rho\\ d\\theta^2}. $$ This flat metric describes a stack of hyperbolic disks, just like the AdS metric. The length of the geodesic and its relation to entanglement entropy are the same in hyperboloidal coordinates. The original RT proposal applies directly to flat spacetime!\nThe RT proposal reveals an interesting interpretation for the area dependence of entropy. It is easier to understand that entanglement entropy should be proportional to the area of a screen and not to the volume behind it. But maybe we should ask first: What is volume?\nThinking outside the ball When we think of volume, we typically envision a box or a ball and consider the space inside. Relativity modifies our intuition about space and time, so it is reasonable that our notion of volume is modified as well. The volume of a region $B$ is the integral of the volume form $$ V_B = \\int_{B} \\sqrt{\\det h} \\ d\\Sigma, $$ and depends on the spatial metric $h$. In flat space we have $\\sqrt{\\det h} =$ $r^2 \\sin\\theta$. The volume of a ball of radius $R$ gives us the usual formula that we memorize at school $$ V_{B(R)} = \\int_{0}^{R} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\int_0^{2 \\pi} r^2 \\sin\\theta \\ dr d\\theta d\\varphi= 4\\pi \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 dr = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}R^3. $$ For the hyperboloidal foliation with $L=1$ we have $$ h = \\frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2,\\quad \\sqrt{\\det h} = \\frac{r^2 \\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}}. $$ The volume expression is a bit more complicated $$ V_{B(R)} = 4\\pi \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{r^2}{\\sqrt{1+r^2}} dr = 2\\pi \\left[ r\\sqrt{1+r^2} - \\ln\\left( r+\\sqrt{1+r^2} \\right) \\right]{0}^{R}. $$ We can get a sense for it using Taylor expansions. For small spheres with $R\\ll 1$, we get the usual result $$ V{B(R)}=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}R^3+O(R^5).$$ For large spheres, however, the series expansion for $R\\gg 1$ gives $$ V_{B(R)}=2\\pi R^2 + O(\\ln R).$$ Remarkably, volume and area scale the same way near the asymptotic boundary in hyperboloidal coordinates.\nThese are suggestive observations about the potential usefulness of hyperboloidal surfaces in holography. And indeed, there is a current effort using hyperboloidal surfaces for holography.\nCelestial Holography In the context of quantum gravity, the holographic principle suggests duality between a gravity theory in the bulk and a quantum theory on the boundary. Celestial holography suggests that asymptotically flat spacetimes are dual to a theory living on the \u0026ldquo;celestial sphere\u0026rdquo; at infinity.\nThe theory uses Bondi coordinates along null infinity to discuss asymptotic symmetries, and switches to a hyperboloidal slicing to discuss massive particles. The slices they use have been first proposed as a cosmological model by Milne in 1935. Milne slices are level sets of $$ \\tau^2 = t^2 - r^2.$$ Introducing the spatial coordinate $$ \\rho = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{t^2-r^2}}, $$ the Minkowski metric takes the form $$ ds^2_{\\rm{Mink}} = -d\\tau^2 + \\tau^2 \\left( \\textcolor{RedViolet}{\\frac{1}{1+\\rho^2} d\\rho^2 + \\rho^2 d\\sigma^2}\\right). $$ Again, we recognize the representation of Minkowski spacetime as a stack of hyperbolic disks. But in this case, the metric coefficients depend on time $\\tau$. And the mean extrinsic curvature of Milne slices vanishes asymptotically in time as $K=3/\\tau$.\nI suspect that the hyperboloidal foliation we discussed above is better than Milne slicing for holography. Consider the Penrose diagram of Milne slices.   Penrose diagram of Milne slicing. Strominger, arXiv (2017)  The Penrose diagram and the metric reveal some undesirable features of Milne slices compared to the hyperboloidal foliation:\n The slices intersect at null infinity. The coordinates are time-dependent. There is no analog of the AdS curvature scale.  In contrast, the hyperboloidal foliation has constant mean curvature, $K=3/L$, playing the same role as the curvature scale in AdS geometry. The coordinates are independent of time and provide a smooth foliation of null infinity. Below are Penrose diagrams for such hyperboloidal, constant-mean-curvature foliations with different values of the mean extrinsic curvature, which acts as a dial between characteristic and Cauchy surfaces.\n   Penrose diagrams of hyperboloidal foliations with different mean extrinsic curvatures $K={6,3,2}$. Zenginoğlu, arXiv (2008)  Milne coordinates have one advantage that a hyperboloidal foliation of null infinity cannot provide. A massive particle in constant motion will asymptote to a point on the Milne slices. Dirac used this property in his 1949 paper on Forms of Relativistic Dynamics and it appears repeatedly in celestial holography. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how important this is. But Milne coordinates are also hyperboloidal. So in that sense, celestial holography is already using hyperboloidal holography.\nCelestial holography is relatively new and developing rapidly. We don\u0026rsquo;t know how the final version will look like. That\u0026rsquo;s the excitement of research.\nWrap up A few curious observations suggest that hyperboloidal coordinates are interesting for holography.\n Flat spacetime becomes a stack of hyperbolic disks, with a cylinder representing the global picture. The original Ryu-Takayanagi calculations apply to Minkowski spacetime. Volume scales as area near the conformal boundary. Spacetime hyperboloids are essential in celestial holography.  Are these observations indicative of a profound duality, an underlying realization of the holographic principle for isolated systems in hyperboloidal coordinates? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. The similarity between Minkowski in hyperboloidal coordinates and AdS is interesting, but it can also be misleading.\nThe observations here are, by their very nature, coordinate-dependent. Suitable coordinates may ease calculations and suggest research directions, but the results should not depend on them. A significant, coordinate-independent difference to the AdS case is the null conformal boundary of asymptotically flat spacetimes. Any realization of the holographic principle will need to incorporate the null boundary and the associated symmetries as celestial holography is attempting to do.\nIt can be misleading to take similarities in specific coordinates too far, but it can also be a missed opportunity to ignore them. I think hyperbolic geometry and hyperboloidal surfaces will keep playing an essential role in holography. Watch this space!\n  There are various subtleties here that I\u0026rsquo;m glossing over.

When presenting my work, I often encounter the objection that infinity is not physical. But not all infinities are created equal, and some are more physical than others. In fact, we can verify by experiment that we are at infinity with respect to distant sources of radiation.\nBelow I collect some thoughts on infinity and describe the experiment. Feel free to skip my ramblings and go directly to the experiment.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t need no infinity Physicists are generally uncomfortable with infinity. First, it is argued, infinity cannot be the outcome of a physical experiment. Second, infinity as the outcome of a calculation indicates problems with the theory. Resolving such problems is important because they may reveal new research directions such as renormalization techniques. Since infinity doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense in experiment and should be avoided in theory, physicists are skeptical when it appears in mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena. A few examples: Max Tegmark argues that infinity is an idea that should be retired from physics; Nicolas Gisin aims to understand time without relying on infinitely precise numbers; and here is a quote from The physics of infinity by Ellis, Meissner, and Nicolai:\n We maintain that in each physical case where $\\infty$ is used in a discussion, greater insight is attained by considering what large number $N$ will suffice instead because real physics is embodied in that number.\n This uneasiness of physicists with infinity is also present in mathematics. There are mathematical philosophies and formalisms without infinity, such as finitism or intuitionism. I was attracted to similar ideas when I was in college, so I went down the rabbit hole of fuzzy numbers. They seemed to \u0026ldquo;naturally\u0026rdquo; represent physical measurements, which are not real numbers with infinite precision but fuzzy numbers with uncertainties. The more I learned about fuzzy numbers, however, the less I was convinced of their general utility. They were cumbersome and did not improve calculations in most cases. I learned, by way of fuzzy numbers, that successful mathematical representations do not necessarily match our physical intuitions. The map is not the territory.\nEmpirical infinity Aristotle distinguishes two notions of infinity: actual and potential. Potential infinity is what children learn first: numbers just keep going \u0026ldquo;forever\u0026rdquo;. Actual infinity is the completion of this process: the set of all numbers as a mathematical object.\nWe do not observe infinity directly but we use it to represent our impressions of the natural world. In a painting, both sides of a road may meet at a vanishing point. The road ends somewhere but the painting suggests that the meeting point is beyond the horizon of perception. The representation of \u0026ldquo;far\u0026rdquo; on the canvas is infinity.\nThe infinity on the canvas is neither potential (it\u0026rsquo;s a finite, completed representation of infinity) nor actual (the horizon is actually at a finite distance). Call it empirical infinity. Empirical concepts are abstracted from individual perceptions. Empirical infinity is the best canvas representation of your perception looking down a long, seemingly unending road. You don\u0026rsquo;t know how far you can see, and you don\u0026rsquo;t care about representing that particular detail in your painting. You just want to express that it\u0026rsquo;s very far.\nA thought experiment Black hole perturbations have a property that is different at infinity and at a finite distance. We can use this property to determine where we are with respect to the black hole. We would need very accurate detectors to measure it, which we don\u0026rsquo;t have yet, so consider this a reasonable thought experiment.\nPerturbations of a black hole go through an oscillatory period, and subsequently decay with a power-law $ \\sim t^p$, where $t$ is time as measured by the observer and $p$ is the negative power1. Surprisingly, the power $p$ is different depending on where you observe the perturbations: -3 at finite distances, -2 at infinity2. The slower decay at infinity is somewhat unexpected. One could argue that the power-law decay, which was first discovered for finite distances, should be non-radiative; it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be detected at infinity. As demonstrated by Gundlach, Price, and Pullin in 1994, it is not only radiative but decays slower at infinity than at finite distances3. There are explanations of this slower decay in terms of accumulation of backscattering off of curvature towards infinity, but this is not our main concern4. Given that the rates at finite distances and infinity are different, we ask the following question:\nWhich decay rate would we observe?\nWe are clearly a finite distance away from the black hole, so the intuitive answer is that we would measure the finite distance rate. However, the correct answer is the infinity rate.\nBelow is a figure from a paper of mine where I studied various decay rates. The figure shows the evolution of the decay rate in time for various distances to the black hole.\n   Decay rates in time at various distances from the source.  The long-time decay rate is -3 for any finite distance as the theory demonstrates. But the theory is valid for the asymptotic limit. Initially, the decay rate for distant observers is much closer to -2 than to -3. The top curve in the figure is the measurement at infinity, and the next closest curve is at 40,000 units of black hole mass (in these units, a solar mass corresponds to a distance of 1.5 km). For a small black hole of 5 solar masses, this observer is about 300,000 km away. This may sound far, but it\u0026rsquo;s just one light second, which is about the distance between the Earth and the Moon. To compare, typical sources of gravitational waves are thousands and millions of light years away. The decay rate of perturbations from such a distant source would be indistinguishable from the infinity value.\nInfinity in astrophysics may be closer than the Moon.\nWrap-up If we ever get to measure the power-law decay from black-hole perturbations, we will measure the infinity value and not the finite distance value, even though we are a finite distance away from the sources. Given that the distances are literally astronomical, it\u0026rsquo;s more practical to use infinity both in our calculations and in our discussions where it\u0026rsquo;s needed, instead of artificially avoiding it.\nI think most people agree that actual infinity doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the real world. But the number 3 also doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the real world. Numbers are useful concepts abstracted from observations and represented in mathematical models. The decay rate experiment demonstrates that infinity is a useful concept in describing astrophysical observations. We should embrace empirical infinity and its appearance in our formalisms as long as it improves our calculations.\nHugo 0.15 will have 30%+ faster render times thanks to this commit https://t.co/FfzhM8bNhT #gohugo #golang https://t.co/ITbMNU2BUf\n\u0026mdash; Steve Francia (@spf13) November 17, 2015  --   This was first discussed in detail by Richard Price in his 1972 paper Nonspherical Perturbations of Relativistic Gravitational Collapse.

For certain merger configurations the time evolution of the magnitude of the kick velocity has a local maximum followed by a sudden drop. Perturbative studies of this “antikick” in a limited range of black hole spins have found that the antikick decreases for retrograde orbits as a function of negative spin. We analyze this problem using a recently developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations from a point particle in Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed radiation reaction force at linear order in the mass ratio $ν≪1$. Extending previous studies to nearly extremal negative spins, thus complementing current numerical relativity knowledge about the recoil, we find that the well-known decrease of the antikick is overturned and, instead of approaching zero, the antikick increases again to reach $Δv/(cν^2)=3.37×10^{−3}$ for dimensionless spin $\\hat{a}=−0.9999$. The corresponding final kick velocity is $v_{end}/(cν^2)=0.076$.

We show that, besides capturing qualitatively the global properties over the whole spin range, $Q$ actually predicts the return of the antikick for $\\hat{a}\\to−1$. Since $Q$ is computed only from the, gauge-invariant, flux of linear momentum, the herein presented verification of its reliability advocates its systematic use also in numerical relativity calculations. In addition, we also connect, in a new way, the properties of the flux to the noncircular character of the plunge dynamics, highlighting the central role of subdominant waveform multipoles in shaping the characteristic interference pattern exhibited by the linear momentum flux as $\\hat{a}\\to−1$.","tags":[],"title":"The antikick strikes back: Recoil velocities for nearly extremal binary black hole mergers in the test-mass limit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Donninger","Anıl Zenginoğlu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1401408e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621996396,"objectID":"7a7cf62f984ecd3853b2a9de0fe05dde","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/publication/donninger-2014-nondispersive/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T02:33:16.654879Z","relpermalink":"/publication/donninger-2014-nondispersive/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the hyperboloidal initial value problem for the cubic focusing wave equation $$ (-\\partial_t^2+\\Delta_x)v(t,x)+v(t,x)^3=0,\\quad x\\in \\mathbb{R}^3. $$ Without symmetry assumptions, we prove the existence of a co-dimension 4 Lipschitz manifold of initial data that lead to global solutions in forward time which do not scatter to free waves.

This paper explores an alternative to the traditional approach, namely, the construction of template banks directly from numerical BBH simulations. Using nonspinning BBH systems as an example, we demonstrate which regions of the mass-parameter plane can be covered with existing numerical BBH waveforms. We estimate the required number and required length of BBH simulations to cover the entire nonspinning BBH parameter plane up to mass ratio 10, thus illustrating that our approach can be used to guide parameter placement of future numerical simulations. We derive error bounds which are independent of analytical waveform models; therefore, our formalism can be used to independently test the accuracy of such waveform models.

The arrival times and the decay rate of these caustic echoes are consistent with propagation along null geodesics and the large $\\ell$ limit of quasinormal modes. We show that the fourfold singularity structure of the retarded Green function is due to the well-known action of a Hilbert transform on the trapped wavefront at caustics. A twofold cycle is obtained for degenerate source-observer configurations along the caustic line, where the energy amplification increases with an inverse power of the scale of the source. Finally, we discuss the tail piece of the solution due to propagation within the light cone, up to and including null infinity, and argue that, even with ideal instruments, only a finite number of echoes can be observed. Putting these pieces together, we provide a heuristic expression that approximates the Green function with a few free parameters.

The conformal compactification technique enables us to calculate spatially unbounded domains, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial timelike outer boundary. We construct in spherical symmetry an explicit scri-fixing gauge, ie a conformal and a coordinate gauge in which the spatial coordinate location of null infinity is independent of time so that no resolution loss in the physical part of the conformal extension appears. Going beyond spherical symmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity in the computational domain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems for the Einstein equations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To study spatial infinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general conformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the first numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution including spatial, null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the singularity. After developing a three dimensional, frame based evolution code with smooth inner and outer boundaries we calculate a radiative axisymmetric vacuum solution in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity represented as a cylinder including a piece of null infinity.
