&lt;p>The featured image on the tweet above shows &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escher&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Limit_III" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle Limit III&lt;/a> depicting the Poincaré model of hyperbolic geometry. Escher was interested in constructing an infinitely repeating pattern in a finite figure. When the brilliant geometer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coxeter&lt;/a> shared with him a reprint of one of his lectures on hyperbolic geometry, Escher figured out how to create such &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tessalations&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-circle-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story&lt;/a> of how Escher managed to create these &lt;a href="https://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/index.php/Circle_Limit_Exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four woodcuts&lt;/a> is fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-close-in-on-logical-laws-for-the-big-bang-20211110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> in the tweet above reports the difficulties in constructing something like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS/CFT correspondence&lt;/a> for physical spacetimes. While we have a realization of holographic duality based on anti-de Sitter spacetimes, a similar construction on flat or de Sitter spacetimes has been elusive, supposedly because these spacetimes do not possess hyperbolic geometry. A week after the tweet above, there was another &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/symmetries-reveal-clues-about-the-holographic-universe-20220112/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> with hyperbolic geometry as its featured image. Clearly, there is some hype around hyperbolic geometry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main argument is that spatial slices of AdS are hyperbolic, which seems to be essential for AdS/CFT, so living in hyperbolic geometry makes it easier for the fish in Escher&amp;rsquo;s drawing to know quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The fish doesn&amp;rsquo;t think because the fish knows everything.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We are, however, not like those fish; we want to discover quantum gravity. The obstacle remains that our physical models for spacetime are either asymptotically flat (for isolated systems) or de Sitter (for cosmology).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I argue below that there is no need to be jealous of the fish. We do live in hyperbolic geometry; we just don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &amp;ldquo;Morning, boys. How&amp;rsquo;s the water?&amp;rdquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &amp;ldquo;What the hell is water?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="little-fish-big-fish">Little fish, big fish&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a short review of the hyperbolic fish in Escher&amp;rsquo;s drawing. Hyperbolic geometry is typically introduced in a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space using the equation for a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloid&lt;/a> in Cartesian coordinates. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using spherical coordinates foreshadowing an application below, so we have the Minkowski space with line element
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2,$$
where $d\sigma^2=d\sigma^2+\sin^2\theta \ d\varphi^2$, the usual metric on the unit sphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spheres and hyperboloids may seem very different, but they are analogous to each other. Just like the unit sphere is the set of points at unit Euclidean distance from the origin, the unit hyperboloid is the set of points at unit Minkowski distance from the origin: the hyperboloid is simply a (pseudo)sphere of Minkowski space
$$t^2-r^2=1. \tag{1} \label{1}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already have the first hint that we live in hyperbolic geometry! The hyperboloid describes the &lt;a href="../../hyperbolic-relativity/">kinematic space of special relativity&lt;/a>. But this was rather anticlimactic so let&amp;rsquo;s go a bit further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can derive and represent the intrinsic metric of hyperbolic geometry in various equivalent ways. For example, setting $t=\cosh \xi$ and $r=\sinh \xi$ satisfies the equation for the hyperboloid (\ref{1}) identically, and gives us the hyperbolic line element
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = d\xi^2+ \sinh^2\xi \ d\sigma^2.$$
Note the similarity of this hyperbolic metric with the metric on the unit sphere.
Coordinates are labels and it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to see hyperbolic geometry in different representations. Instead of introducing hyperbolic functions, let&amp;rsquo;s solve (\ref{1}) directly
$$ t = \sqrt{1+r^2}. \tag{2} \label{2} $$
Replacing the $dt$ term with the differential of this relation in the Minkowski metric, we get
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}. \tag{3} \label{3} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get Escher&amp;rsquo;s image of a disk, we need to map the hyperboloid model with its infinite range in $r$ to the unit &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poincaré disk model&lt;/a>. We relabel the radial points using
$$ r = \frac{2\rho}{1-\rho^2}, \tag{4}\label{4}$$
and obtain the familiar &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model#Metric_and_curvature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line element for the Poincaré ball&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = \textcolor{darkorange}{\frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2}\left( d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2 \right)}. $$
The metric blows up near the boundary, which is how Escher packs the infinitely many fish in a repeating pattern into the disk. Remember that the fish have the same size. The Poincaré disk is a conformal model of hyperbolic geometry distorting sizes but keeping the shapes (or rather local angles) invariant, so the fish actually don&amp;rsquo;t know that they are packed so densely, contrary to claims about their omniscient nature. As far as the fish are concerned, they don&amp;rsquo;t see the distortions and might even think they live in flat space&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &amp;#x1f609;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="swimming-in-anti-de-sitter">Swimming in anti-de Sitter&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The hype around hyperbolic geometry among quanta is because cuts of AdS are hyperbolic spaces. In fact, AdS is introduced very similarly to hyperbolic geometry&amp;mdash;starting with a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space. This Minkowski space, however, has two time dimensions (which is rather awkward): $ds^2 = -dt_1^2 - dt_2^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$. We write the hyperboloid as $-t_1^2-t_2^2+r^2=-1$. This relation can be solved identically by $t_1 = \sqrt{1+r^2} \cos t$ and $t_2 = \sqrt{1+r^2} \sin t$, giving the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space#Global_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS metric in global coordinates&lt;/a>
$$ ds^2_{\rm{AdS}} = - \left(1+r^2\right) dt^2 + \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}.$$
AdS spacetime has many &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counterintuitive aspects&lt;/a>; it&amp;rsquo;s not even stable against small &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perturbations&lt;/a>. But you can immediately see that its $t$-slices have hyperbolic geometry by comparing them to the metric (\ref{3}), which is the crucial aspect for quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I promised you to end your jealousy, but so far, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been pressing on the wound. The question remains: how do we go from our usual flat spacetime with line element
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$$
to the hyperbolic three-metric as time slices? Yes, we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the kinematic space of special relativity, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a spacetime metric&amp;mdash;time is missing! Considering the usual time slices, there is nothing hyperbolic about the flat geometry of $dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="time-heals-all-wounds">Time heals all wounds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In relativity, there is no notion of absolute time; we can develop our own simultaneity to connect observers and call it a proper day. Therefore, the geometry of the three-space connecting these observers is also not invariant but depends on a choice of time. Many familiar notions such as simultaneity, volume, area become unfamiliar through such reparametrizations of spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The choice of time also determines whether the geometry of the three-space is Euclidean or hyperbolic. We are free to pick our preferred time coordinate, so let&amp;rsquo;s pick a time that makes space hyperbolic and end the jealousy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen this when we encountered the kinematic space of special relativity in our derivation of the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry. Now, instead of finding intrinsic coordinates as in (\ref{2}), we introduce a new time coordinate as
$$ \tau = t - \sqrt{1+r^2}. \tag{5} \label{5} $$
The resulting metric is not a three-dimensional intrinsic spatial metric but a transformed Minkowski metric with timelike, null, and spacelike directions
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 - \frac{2r}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} d\tau dr + \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}.$$
Voilà! The $\tau$ slices have hyperbolic geometry. Relabeling the radial points as in (\ref{4}) brings us to a foliation whose sections are the Poincaré balls
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 + \frac{8\rho}{(1-\rho^2)^2} d\tau d\rho + \textcolor{darkorange}{\frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2} \left( d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2\right)}.$$
Note that this metric is still the flat Minkowski metric with all its usual geometric properties, such as vanishing curvature. The important difference is that the points along the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_%28topology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideal boundary&lt;/a> do not sit at spatial infinity but null infinity. The cuts $\rho=1$ along each $\tau$ slice corresponds to what is called a celestial sphere. This allows us to make the connection back to quantum gravity, because the celestial sphere is indeed the stage for an attempt at a &lt;a href="../../hyperboloidal-holography/">holographic description&lt;/a> called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celestial holography&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ideal boundary seems like an ideal place for quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbolic-de-sitter">Hyperbolic de Sitter&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-close-in-on-logical-laws-for-the-big-bang-20211110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> discusses the difficulties in constructing an AdS/CFT correspondence in de Sitter spacetimes. Again, we can use coordinates to make the time slices of de Sitter hyperbolic, but the transformations are a bit tricky because de Sitter space has a different conformal geometry. For example, conformal infinity is spacelike (as opposed to timelike for AdS and null for Minkowski).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is another infinity in de Sitter that depends on coordinates and is useful for us. Consider the de Sitter metric in static coordinates
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - \left(1-r^2\right) dt^2 + \frac{1}{1-r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2.$$
The singularity at $r=1$ corresponds to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cosmological horizon&lt;/a>. The horizon singularity is a coordinate singularity similar to the singularity at the black hole horizon of Schwarzschild spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the transformation that gets us to hyperbolic time slices
$$ r = \sinh \xi \sinh \tau, \qquad \cosh t = \frac{\cosh \tau}{\sqrt{1-\sinh^2 \xi \sinh^2\tau}} $$
The transformed metric is comparatively simple
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - d\tau^2 + \sinh ^2 \tau \left( d\xi^2 + \sinh^2\xi\ d\sigma^2 \right).$$
We recognize the hyperbolic geometry on $\tau=$const. slices. Alternatively, we can abuse notation and use the same letter for $r=\sinh\xi$ to get the purple representation of the hyperbolic metric
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - d\tau^2 + \sinh ^2 \tau \left( \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2} \right).$$
The Poincaré disk follows from a simple relabeling of the radial points (\ref{4}). This representation of the de Sitter metric is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space#Open_slicing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open slicing&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring subtleties, such as the domain of transformations and the region covered by coordinates in the conformal diagram. We still see that we can choose to live in hyperbolic geometry if we want to, even in de Sitter spacetimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with the de Sitter metric in open slicing is its time-dependence. Especially for numerical studies, coordinates in which the metric is explicitly static are preferable. A better approach to construct a hyperbolic slicing is to consider the static patch and make a transformation similar to the flat case. First we push the horizon to infinity
$$ r_\ast = \int \frac{1}{1-r^2}dr = \mathrm{arctanh} \ r. $$
The de Sitter metric on the static patch becomes
$$ ds^2_{\mathrm{dS}} = \frac{1}{\cosh^2 r_\ast} \left( -dt^2 + dr_\ast^2 \right) + \tanh^2 r_\ast d\sigma^2. $$
Now we can do the same transformation as in (\ref{5}), take $\tau=$const., and get the following metric on the time slices
$$ \frac{1}{\cosh^2 r_\ast} \left(\frac{1}{1+r_\ast^2} dr_\ast^2 + \sinh^2 r_\ast d\sigma^2 \right). $$
This metric is not quite the hyperbolic metric, but has other nice properties for numerical calculations that I&amp;rsquo;ll write about in another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="this-is-water">This is Water&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The point of this post is that you can find suitable coordinates that make space hyperbolic. There is nothing to be jealous about Escher&amp;rsquo;s fish. It may well be that physically motivated time slices of flat spacetime are naturally hyperbolic but we don&amp;rsquo;t experience it because the speed of light is so large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are these time transformations physically motivated? What do they mean? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t a preferred time slice contradict the principle of covariance? I&amp;rsquo;ll leave those questions for another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy the swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was blown away by this as a young high schooler interested in physics and philosophy. To me, the recognition that natural laws dynamically govern space and time was a triumph of physics over philosophy, of Einstein over Kant, of empirical determination over &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic%E2%80%93synthetic_distinction#Kant%27s_version_and_the_a_priori_/_a_posteriori_distinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic a priori&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As fascinated as I was by special relativity, the formalism seemed relatively obscure. I recognized patterns in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lorentz transformations&lt;/a> but missed a deeper insight into the origins of this structure. At college, I considered various standard derivations of relativistic effects, such as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_aberration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relativistic aberration&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_precession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas precession&lt;/a>, tedious and boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple example is Einstein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">velocity-addition formula&lt;/a>. In Galilean relativity, which corresponds to our everyday experience, we can just add velocities. In special relativity, the speed of light is constant, so the addition of velocities must be such that no composition of velocities exceeds the speed of light. In the simplest case of collinear motion (velocities pointing in the same direction), velocity addition becomes speed addition and looks like this
$$ \tag{1} \label{1}
u = \frac{u_1+u_2}{1+\tfrac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}} $$
The speed of light, $c$, can never be exceeded with this composition law. While we can understand the result, it is not intuitively clear how this addition rule is related to the structure of space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that relativistic calculations have natural interpretations in hyperbolic geometry. This viewpoint not only simplifies the calculations but also provides deeper insights into the theory. Its power extends beyond special relativity into machine learning and general relativity. And it all starts with Minkowski.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbole">Hyperbole&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 1908, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&lt;/a> gave a &lt;a href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/~tschinke/papers/yuri/14minkowski/raum-und-zeit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lecture&lt;/a> about a new mathematical model for space and time. In his opening remarks, he stated boldly that, from now on, space and time are mere shadows of a more fundamental union: spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&lt;/a> (1908)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The quote is by now famous. It has made its way to various outlets since appearing on the cover page of Synge&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relativity-Special-J-L-Synge/dp/B000GP7PX4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">textbook on relativity&lt;/a> in 1956. But when Minkowski made the statement, it was considered hyperbole and encountered resistance from physicists and mathematicians alike.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spacetime view became widely celebrated a few years after the lecture because of its central role in general relativity. In the same lecture, Minkowski also promoted a non-Euclidean approach to spacetime. As a Göttingen mathematics professor, he recognized the non-Euclidean geometry of special relativity. This idea, however, didn&amp;rsquo;t gain traction as widely as the idea of spacetime. Only in the last 20 years has there been renewed interest in the hyperbolic nature of special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To see why hyperbolic geometry is the natural geometry for special relativity, consider a two-dimensional spacetime with coordinates $(t,x)$ and Minkowski metric
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2. $$
A natural object for a metric is the set of points at unit distance from the origin. In two-dimensional Euclidean space, we get a circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. In two-dimensional Minkowski space, we get a hyperbola&lt;br>
$$ \tag{2}\label{2} t^2 - x^2 = 1. $$
Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s drawing below shows this hyperbola for $t&amp;gt;0$. In higher dimensions, you get the one-sheeted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloid&lt;/a>, also called hyperbolic hyperboloid.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In his lecture, Minkowski demonstrated that Lorentz transformations are hyperbolic rotations that leave the hyperbola (\ref{2}) invariant. He died in January 1909 before he could develop this idea further, but it was embraced by a few other scientists, particularly by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sommerfeld&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vari%C4%87ak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varičak&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Robb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robb&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borel&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The principle of relativity corresponds to the hypothesis that the kinematic space is a space of constant negative curvature, the space of Lobachevsky and Bolyai. The value of the radius of curvature is the speed of light.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The mathematical formalism for a hyperbolic rotation is just like a regular rotation, except with hyperbolic functions instead of trigonometric functions. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperbolic functions&lt;/a> are related to their trigonometric counterparts through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions#Complex_trigonometric_definitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex angles&lt;/a>. An intuitive way to think about the hyperbolic rotation is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squeeze mapping&lt;/a>, which should be familiar to anyone who has seen a Lorentz transformation on a spacetime diagram.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the Lorentz boost with relative speed $v$ between frames
$$ L(v)= \begin{pmatrix}
\gamma &amp;amp; -\gamma \beta \\
-\gamma \beta &amp;amp; \gamma
\end{pmatrix}, $$
where we defined the rescaled speed $\beta:=\tfrac{v}{c}$ and the Lorentz factor $\gamma:=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$. We can write it as a hyperbolic rotation with angle $w$:
$$ L(w)= \begin{pmatrix}
\cosh w &amp;amp; -\sinh w \\
-\sinh w &amp;amp; \cosh w
\end{pmatrix}, $$
where the Lorentz factor becomes $\gamma=\cosh w$ and the rescaled speed becomes $\beta=\tanh w$. So the Lorentz transformation is simply a rotation in hyperbolic space with an angle, $w$, related to the observer&amp;rsquo;s speed as $v=c \ \mathrm{arctanh}\ w$. Its inverse is just a rotation with the inverse angle, $L(w)^{-1}=L(-w)$. We can directly add the hyperbolic angles instead of dealing with weird addition formulas because composition of rotations along the same dimension is additive $L(w_1)L(w_2)=L(w_1+w_2)$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Physicists usually think in terms of velocities and speeds, not hyperbolic angles. Writing the angle addition in terms of speeds, we get
$$ \beta = \tanh (w_1+w_2) = \frac{\tanh w_1+\tanh w_2}{1+\tanh w_1 \tanh w_2} = \frac{\beta_1+\beta_2}{1+\beta_1 \beta_2}. $$
Einstein&amp;rsquo;s velocity addition (\ref{1}) becomes a consequence of hyperbolic identities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is much more that one can simplify or understand with this viewpoint. For example, the formula for the Doppler shift is a simple $e^w$. The non-commutativity of general Lorentz boosts in higher dimensions becomes immediately apparent: Lorentz boosts do not commute just like rotations do not commute. The Thomas precession becomes easier to visualize as the consequence of parallel transport of vectors in the curved velocity space (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holonomy transformation&lt;/a>). Many other calculations and ideas in special relativity translate to simple exercises in hyperbolic geometry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re intrigued, follow the rabbit. Scott Walter&amp;rsquo;s papers are excellent for the historical developments: &lt;a href="https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00319209/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hermann Minkowski and the scandal of spacetime&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.6918&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Non-Euclidean Style of Minkowskian Relativity&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01234434/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s modern world&lt;/a>. There are some gems in Barrett&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hyperbolic Theory of Special Relativity&lt;/a>. Rhodes and Semon go into those tedious calculations in &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0501070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relativistic velocity space, Wigner rotation and Thomas precession&lt;/a>. Tevian Dray&amp;rsquo;s textbook on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Special-Relativity-Tevian-Dray/dp/1466510471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Geometry of Special Relativity&lt;/a> from 2012 takes the hyperbolic viewpoint to teach special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ungar probably has the most influential and extensive work in this space. His books on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gyrovector space&lt;/a> present relativistic calculations in hyperbolic geometry from a solid group-theoretical viewpoint. Two of his relevant books are &lt;a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analytic Hyperbolic Geometry and Albert Einstein&amp;rsquo;s Special Theory of Relativity&lt;/a> from 2008 and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-306-47134-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond the Einstein Addition Law and its Gyroscopic Thomas Precession&lt;/a> from 2012. This work has even found applications in machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="beyond-special">Beyond special&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The hyperbolic view opens a new window to a universe beyond rewriting calculations in special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hyperbolic geometry efficiently represents &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hierarchical relationships and complex networks&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nickel and Kiela&lt;/a> demonstrated in 2017 that hyperbolic geometry is better than Euclidean geometry when applying machine learning to complex data structures. In a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up paper&lt;/a>, they compared different hyperbolic models for learning hierarchical relationships and found that the Lorentz model is more efficient than the Poincaré model. Around the same time, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ganea, Bécigneul, and Hofmann&lt;/a> derived hyperbolic versions of deep learning tools by using Ungar&amp;rsquo;s gyrovector formalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These papers opened up a new research direction in machine learning on &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04562" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic deep neural networks&lt;/a>. The researchers use tools developed specifically for special relativity, such as Lorentz transformations and gyrovector spaces, to improve machine learning algorithms. Physicists usually associate velocities and universal speed limits with Lorentz transformations. It is fascinating that Lorentz transformations arise in problems without a notion of motion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another application closer to my heart is hyperbolic geometry in general relativity. The spacetime of special relativity is special: we can identify Minkowski space with its tangent space which allows us to talk of spacetime events as four-vectors and apply global Lorentz transformations. These properties do not generalize to arbitrary Lorentzian manifolds. It&amp;rsquo;s not immediately evident that the hyperbolic viewpoint is still valuable when the spacetime is curved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we have seen above, Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s hyperboloid (\ref{2}) consists of points at unit proper distance from the origin. Hyperboloids are as natural in Minkowski space as spheres are in Euclidean space. So &lt;strong>hyperboloidal&lt;/strong> coordinates may be as natural in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can we construct such hyperboloidal coordinates? In many applications, we need to separate spacetime into space and time. Let&amp;rsquo;s separate spacetime into hyperbolic space and time in non-Euclidean style. One approach is to take a hint from spherical coordinates. Generalize the hyperbola from (\ref{2}) to an arbitrary radius of curvature
$$ t^2-x^2 = \tau^2, $$
and use $\tau$ as a new coordinate. Setting $x=\tau \ \sinh \rho$ gives us the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milne universe&lt;/a> with metric
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \tau^2 d\xi^2.$$
These coordinates have various use cases today, including &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum field theory&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holography&lt;/a>, and the theory of &lt;a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial differential equations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another approach is to shift the hyperbola (\ref{2}) along the time direction by $\tau$ recognizing the special role of time
$$ (\tau - t)^2 - x^2 = 1 $$
Using $\tau$ as the new time coordinate, the Minkowski metric becomes
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \frac{2x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} d\tau dx + \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx^2.$$
Level sets of $\tau$ are hyperbolic spaces. We can bring the metric into the more recognizable Poincaré form by the spatial transformation $x=2 \rho/(1-\rho^2)$.
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2} \left(2\rho d\tau d\rho + d\rho^2\right).$$
This construction generalizes to &lt;a href="../../publication/zenginoglu-2008-hyperboloidal/">curved spacetimes&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s favorable for numerically solving wave equations because the coefficients don&amp;rsquo;t depend on time. Some of the problems appearing in standard coordinates, such as the outer boundary and radiation extraction problems, &lt;a href="../../publication/zenginoglu-2011-hyperboloidal/">don&amp;rsquo;t arise with this approach&lt;/a> because we can solve the wave equation on the infinite spatial domain $\rho\in[0,1]$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hyperboloidal coordinates may seem unnatural at first, but that&amp;rsquo;s because we are used to thinking about space and time in Newtonian terms. Once you spend some time with them, you see that hyperboloidal coordinates are as valuable in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds. I devoted most of my &lt;a href="../../publication/">work&lt;/a> exploring properties of these surfaces and I find their relation to special relativity fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperclusion">Hyperclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Physics doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about how we make calculations in special relativity. The Wikipedia page for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lorentz_transformations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of Lorentz transformations&lt;/a> lists many equivalent formalisms. We could keep the usual relativistic formulas using velocities and Lorentz factors, or employ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_k-calculus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bondi&amp;rsquo;s $k$-calculus&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ungar&amp;rsquo;s gyrovector space&lt;/a>. Why choose one over the other?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It may be just personal preference. How do you understand? I understand by analogy, so it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to me when formalisms lend themselves to connections to other fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is another, much more relevant reason to prefer the hyperbolic viewpoint. As scientists, we want powerful descriptions. The same thinking style should apply to a broad class of phenomena. In other words, we want to avoid overfitting our formalism to the phenomena at hand. Hyperbolic calculations translate into machine learning, spacetime curvature, and maybe other areas to be discovered. The non-Euclidean approach with hyperbolic angles seems more powerful than the usual approach with velocities.&lt;/p>
