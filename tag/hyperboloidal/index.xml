Escher was interested in constructing an infinitely repeating pattern in a finite figure. When the brilliant geometer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coxeter&lt;/a> shared with him a reprint of one of his lectures on hyperbolic geometry, Escher figured out how to create such &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tessalations&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-circle-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story&lt;/a> of how Escher managed to create these &lt;a href="%28https://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/index.php/Circle_Limit_Exploration%29">four woodcuts&lt;/a> is fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-close-in-on-logical-laws-for-the-big-bang-20211110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> in the tweet above reports the difficulties in constructing something like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS/CFT correspondence&lt;/a> for physical spacetimes. While we have a realization of holographic duality based on anti-de Sitter spacetimes, a similar construction on flat or de Sitter spacetimes has been elusive, supposedly because these spacetimes do not possess hyperbolic geometry. A week after the tweet above, there was another &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/symmetries-reveal-clues-about-the-holographic-universe-20220112/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> with hyperbolic geometry as its featured image. Clearly, there is some hype around hyperbolic geometry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main argument is that spatial slices of AdS are hyperbolic, which seems to be essential for AdS/CFT, so living in hyperbolic geometry makes it easier for the fish in Escher&amp;rsquo;s drawing to know quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The fish doesn&amp;rsquo;t think because the fish knows everything.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We are, however, not like those fish; we want to discover quantum gravity. The obstacle remains that our physical models for spacetime are either asymptotically flat (for isolated systems) or de Sitter (for cosmology).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I argue below that there is no need to be jealous of the fish. We do live in hyperbolic geometry; we just don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="little-fish-big-fish">Little fish, big fish&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a short review of the hyperbolic fish in Escher&amp;rsquo;s drawing. Hyperbolic geometry is typically introduced in a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space using the equation for a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloid&lt;/a> in Cartesian coordinates. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using spherical coordinates foreshadowing an application below, so we have the Minkowski space with line element
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2,$$
where $d\sigma^2=d\sigma^2+\sin^2\theta \ d\varphi^2$ is the usual metric on the unit sphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spheres and hyperboloids may seem very different, but they are analogous to each other. Just like the unit sphere is the set of points at unit Euclidean distance from the origin, the unit hyperboloid is the set of points at unit Minkowski distance from the origin: the hyperboloid is simply a (pseudo)sphere of Minkowski space
$$t^2-r^2=1. \tag{1} \label{1}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already have the first hint that we live in hyperbolic geometry! The hyperboloid describes the &lt;a href="../../hyperbolic-relativity/">kinematic space of special relativity&lt;/a>. But this was rather anticlimactic so let&amp;rsquo;s go a bit further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can derive and represent the intrinsic metric of hyperbolic geometry in various equivalent ways. For example, setting $t=\cosh \xi$ and $r=\sinh \xi$ satisfies the equation for the hyperboloid (\ref{1}) identically, and gives us the hyperbolic line element
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = d\xi^2+ \sinh^2\xi \ d\sigma^2.$$
Note the similarity of this hyperbolic metric with the metric on the unit sphere.
Coordinates are labels and it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to see hyperbolic geometry in different representations. Instead of introducing hyperbolic functions, let&amp;rsquo;s solve (\ref{1}) directly
$$ t = \sqrt{1+r^2}. \tag{2} \label{2} $$
Replacing the $dt$ term with the differential of this relation in the Minkowski metric, we get
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}. \tag{3} \label{3} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get Escher&amp;rsquo;s image of a disk, we need to map the hyperboloid model with its infinite range in $r$ to the unit &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poincaré disk model&lt;/a>. We relabel the radial points using
$$ r = \frac{2\rho}{1-\rho^2}, \tag{4}\label{4}$$
and obtain the familiar &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model#Metric_and_curvature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line element for the Poincaré ball&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = \textcolor{darkorange}{\frac{4}{1-\rho^2}\left( d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2 \right)}. $$
The metric blows up near the boundary, which is how Escher packs the infinitely many fish in a repeating pattern into the disk. Remember that the fish have the same size. The Poincaré disk is a conformal model of hyperbolic geometry distorting sizes but keeping the shapes (or rather local angles) invariant, so the fish actually don&amp;rsquo;t know that they are packed so densely, contrary to claims about their omniscient nature. As far as the fish are concerned, they don&amp;rsquo;t see the distortions and might even think they live in flat space&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> 😉.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="swimming-in-anti-de-sitter">Swimming in anti-de Sitter&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The hype around hyperbolic geometry among quanta is because cuts of AdS are hyperbolic spaces. In fact, AdS is introduced very similarly to hyperbolic geometry&amp;mdash;starting with a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space. This Minkowski space, however, has two time dimensions (which is rather awkward): $ds^2 = -dt_1^2 - dt_2^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$. We write the hyperboloid as $-t_1^2-t_2^2+r^2=-1$. This relation can be solved identically by $t_1 = \sqrt{1+r^2} \cos t$ and $t_2 = \sqrt{1+r^2} \sin t$, giving the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space#Global_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS metric in global coordinates&lt;/a>
$$ ds^2_{\rm{AdS}} = - \left(1+r^2\right) dt^2 + \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}.$$
AdS spacetime has many &lt;a href="%28https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01118%29">counterintuitive aspects&lt;/a>; it&amp;rsquo;s not even stable against small &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perturbations&lt;/a>. But you can immediately see that its $t$-slices have hyperbolic geometry by comparing them to the metric (\ref{3}), which is the crucial aspect for quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I promised you to end your jealousy, but so far, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been pressing on the wound. The question remains: how do we go from our usual flat spacetime with line element
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$$
to the hyperbolic three-metric as time slices? Yes, we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the kinematic space of special relativity, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a spacetime metric&amp;mdash;time is missing! Considering the usual time slices, there is nothing hyperbolic about the flat geometry of $dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="time-heals-all-wounds">Time heals all wounds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In relativity, there is no notion of absolute time; we can develop our own simultaneity to connect observers and call it a proper day. Therefore, the geometry of the three-space connecting these observers is also not invariant but depends on a choice of time. Many familiar notions such as simultaneity, volume, area become unfamiliar through such reparametrizations of spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The choice of time also determines whether the geometry of the three-space is Euclidean or hyperbolic. We are free to pick our preferred time coordinate, so let&amp;rsquo;s pick a time that makes space hyperbolic and end the jealousy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen this when we encountered the kinematic space of special relativity in our derivation of the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry. Now, instead of finding intrinsic coordinates as in (\ref{2}), we introduce a new time coordinate as
$$ \tau = t - \sqrt{1+r^2}. \tag{5} \label{5} $$
The resulting metric is not a three-dimensional intrinsic spatial metric but a transformed Minkowski metric with timelike, null, and spacelike directions
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 - \frac{2r}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} d\tau dr + \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}.$$
Voilà! The $\tau$ slices have hyperbolic geometry. Relabeling the radial points as in (\ref{4}) brings us to a foliation whose sections are the Poincaré balls
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 + \frac{8\rho}{(1-\rho^2)^2} d\tau d\rho + \textcolor{darkorange}{\frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2} \left( d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2\right)}.$$
Note that this metric is still the flat Minkowski metric with all its usual geometric properties, such as vanishing curvature. The important difference is that the points along the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_%28topology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideal boundary&lt;/a> do not sit at spatial infinity but null infinity. The cuts $\rho=1$ along each $\tau$ slice corresponds to what is called a celestial sphere. This allows us to make the connection back to quantum gravity, because the celestial sphere is indeed the stage for an attempt at a &lt;a href="../../hyperboloidal-holography/">holographic description&lt;/a> called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celestial holography&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ideal boundary seems like an ideal place for quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbolic-de-sitter">Hyperbolic de Sitter&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-close-in-on-logical-laws-for-the-big-bang-20211110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> discusses the difficulties in constructing an AdS/CFT correspondence in de Sitter spacetimes. Again, we can use coordinates to make the time slices of de Sitter hyperbolic, but the transformations are a bit tricky because de Sitter space has a different conformal geometry. For example, conformal infinity is spacelike (as opposed to timelike for AdS and null for Minkowski).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is another infinity in de Sitter that depends on coordinates and is useful for us. Consider the de Sitter metric in static coordinates
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - \left(1-r^2\right) dt^2 + \frac{1}{1-r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2.$$
The singularity at $r=1$ corresponds to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cosmological horizon&lt;/a>. The horizon singularity is a coordinate singularity similar to the singularity at the black hole horizon of Schwarzschild spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the transformation that gets us to hyperbolic time slices
$$ r = \sinh \xi \sinh \tau, \qquad \cosh t = \frac{\cosh \tau}{\sqrt{1-\sinh^2 \xi \sinh^2\tau}} $$
The transformed metric is comparatively simple
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - d\tau^2 + \sinh ^2 \tau \left( d\xi^2 + \sinh^2\xi\ d\sigma^2 \right).$$
We recognize the hyperbolic geometry on $\tau=$const. slices. Alternatively, we can abuse notation and use the same letter for $r=\sinh\xi$ to get the purple representation of the hyperbolic metric
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - d\tau^2 + \sinh ^2 \tau \left( \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2} \right).$$
The Poincaré disk follows from a simple relabeling of the radial points (\ref{4}). This representation of the de Sitter metric is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space#Open_slicing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open slicing&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring subtleties, such as the domain of transformations and the region covered by coordinates in the conformal diagram. We still see that we can choose to live in hyperbolic geometry if we want to, even in de Sitter spacetimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with the de Sitter metric in open slicing is its time-dependence. Especially for numerical studies, coordinates in which the metric is explicitly static are preferable. A better approach to construct a hyperbolic slicing is to consider the static patch and make a transformation similar to the flat case. First we push the horizon to infinity
$$ r_\ast = \int \frac{1}{1-r^2}dr = \mathrm{arctanh} \ r. $$
The de Sitter metric on the static patch becomes
$$ ds^2_{\mathrm{dS}} = \frac{1}{\cosh^2 r_\ast} \left( -dt^2 + dr_\ast^2 \right) + \tanh^2 r_\ast d\sigma^2. $$
Now we can do the same transformation as in (\ref{5}), take $\tau=$const., and get the following metric on the time slices
$$ \frac{1}{\cosh^2 r_\ast} \left(\frac{1}{1+r_\ast^2} dr_\ast^2 + \sinh^2 r_\ast d\sigma^2 \right). $$
This metric is not quite the hyperbolic metric, but has other nice properties for numerical calculations that I&amp;rsquo;ll write about in another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="this-is-water">This is Water&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The point of this post is that you can find suitable coordinates that make space hyperbolic. There is nothing to be jealous about Escher&amp;rsquo;s fish. It may well be that physically motivated time slices of flat spacetime are naturally hyperbolic but we don&amp;rsquo;t experience it because the speed of light is so large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are these time transformations physically motivated? What do they mean? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t a preferred time slice contradict the principle of covariance? I&amp;rsquo;ll leave those questions for another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy the swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was blown away by this as a young high schooler interested in physics and philosophy. To me, the recognition that natural laws dynamically govern space and time was a triumph of physics over philosophy, of Einstein over Kant, of empirical determination over &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic%E2%80%93synthetic_distinction#Kant%27s_version_and_the_a_priori_/_a_posteriori_distinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic a priori&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As fascinated as I was by special relativity, the formalism seemed relatively obscure. I recognized patterns in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lorentz transformations&lt;/a> but missed a deeper insight into the origins of this structure. At college, I considered various standard derivations of relativistic effects, such as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_aberration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relativistic aberration&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_precession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas precession&lt;/a>, tedious and boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple example is Einstein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">velocity-addition formula&lt;/a>. In Galilean relativity, which corresponds to our everyday experience, we can just add velocities. In special relativity, the speed of light is constant, so the addition of velocities must be such that no composition of velocities exceeds the speed of light. In the simplest case of collinear motion (velocities pointing in the same direction), velocity addition becomes speed addition and looks like this
$$ \tag{1} \label{1}
u = \frac{u_1+u_2}{1+\tfrac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}} $$
The speed of light, $c$, can never be exceeded with this composition law. While we can understand the result, it is not intuitively clear how this addition rule is related to the structure of space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that relativistic calculations have natural interpretations in hyperbolic geometry. This viewpoint not only simplifies the calculations but also provides deeper insights into the theory. Its power extends beyond special relativity into machine learning and general relativity. And it all starts with Minkowski.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbole">Hyperbole&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 1908, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&lt;/a> gave a &lt;a href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/~tschinke/papers/yuri/14minkowski/raum-und-zeit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lecture&lt;/a> about a new mathematical model for space and time. In his opening remarks, he stated boldly that, from now on, space and time are mere shadows of a more fundamental union: spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&lt;/a> (1908)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The quote is by now famous. It has made its way to various outlets since appearing on the cover page of Synge&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relativity-Special-J-L-Synge/dp/B000GP7PX4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">textbook on relativity&lt;/a> in 1956. But when Minkowski made the statement, it was considered hyperbole and encountered resistance from physicists and mathematicians alike.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spacetime view became widely celebrated a few years after the lecture because of its central role in general relativity. In the same lecture, Minkowski also promoted a non-Euclidean approach to spacetime. As a Göttingen mathematics professor, he recognized the non-Euclidean geometry of special relativity. This idea, however, didn&amp;rsquo;t gain traction as widely as the idea of spacetime. Only in the last 20 years has there been renewed interest in the hyperbolic nature of special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To see why hyperbolic geometry is the natural geometry for special relativity, consider a two-dimensional spacetime with coordinates $(t,x)$ and Minkowski metric
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2. $$
A natural object for a metric is the set of points at unit distance from the origin. In two-dimensional Euclidean space, we get a circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. In two-dimensional Minkowski space, we get a hyperbola&lt;br>
$$ \tag{2}\label{2} t^2 - x^2 = 1. $$
Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s drawing below shows this hyperbola for $t&amp;gt;0$. In higher dimensions, you get the one-sheeted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloid&lt;/a>, also called hyperbolic hyperboloid.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In his lecture, Minkowski demonstrated that Lorentz transformations are hyperbolic rotations that leave the hyperbola (\ref{2}) invariant. He died in January 1909 before he could develop this idea further, but it was embraced by a few other scientists, particularly by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sommerfeld&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vari%C4%87ak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varičak&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Robb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robb&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borel&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The mathematical formalism for a hyperbolic rotation is just like a regular rotation, except with hyperbolic functions instead of trigonometric functions. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperbolic functions&lt;/a> are related to their trigonometric counterparts through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions#Complex_trigonometric_definitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex angles&lt;/a>. An intuitive way to think about the hyperbolic rotation is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squeeze mapping&lt;/a>, which should be familiar to anyone who has seen a Lorentz transformation on a spacetime diagram.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the Lorentz boost with relative speed $v$ between frames
$$ L(v)= \begin{pmatrix}
\gamma &amp;amp; -\gamma \beta \\
-\gamma \beta &amp;amp; \gamma
\end{pmatrix}, $$
where we defined the rescaled speed $\beta:=\tfrac{v}{c}$ and the Lorentz factor $\gamma:=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$. We can write it as a hyperbolic rotation with angle $w$:
$$ L(w)= \begin{pmatrix}
\cosh w &amp;amp; -\sinh w \\
-\sinh w &amp;amp; \cosh w
\end{pmatrix}, $$
where the Lorentz factor becomes $\gamma=\cosh w$ and the rescaled speed becomes $\beta=\tanh w$. So the Lorentz transformation is simply a rotation in hyperbolic space with an angle, $w$, related to the observer&amp;rsquo;s speed as $v=c \ \mathrm{arctanh}\ w$. Its inverse is just a rotation with the inverse angle, $L(w)^{-1}=L(-w)$. We can directly add the hyperbolic angles instead of dealing with weird addition formulas because composition of rotations along the same dimension is additive $L(w_1)L(w_2)=L(w_1+w_2)$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Physicists usually think in terms of velocities and speeds, not hyperbolic angles. Writing the angle addition in terms of speeds, we get
$$ \beta = \tanh (w_1+w_2) = \frac{\tanh w_1+\tanh w_2}{1+\tanh w_1 \tanh w_2} = \frac{\beta_1+\beta_2}{1+\beta_1 \beta_2}. $$
Einstein&amp;rsquo;s velocity addition (\ref{1}) becomes a consequence of hyperbolic identities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is much more that one can simplify or understand with this viewpoint. For example, the formula for the Doppler shift is a simple $e^w$. The non-commutativity of general Lorentz boosts in higher dimensions becomes immediately apparent: Lorentz boosts do not commute just like rotations do not commute. The Thomas precession becomes easier to visualize as the consequence of parallel transport of vectors in the curved velocity space (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holonomy transformation&lt;/a>). Many other calculations and ideas in special relativity translate to simple exercises in hyperbolic geometry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re intrigued, follow the rabbit. Scott Walter&amp;rsquo;s papers are excellent for the historical developments: &lt;a href="https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00319209/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hermann Minkowski and the scandal of spacetime&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.6918&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Non-Euclidean Style of Minkowskian Relativity&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01234434/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s modern world&lt;/a>. There are some gems in Barrett&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hyperbolic Theory of Special Relativity&lt;/a>. Rhodes and Semon go into those tedious calculations in &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0501070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relativistic velocity space, Wigner rotation and Thomas precession&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Ungar probably has the most influential and extensive work in this space. His books on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gyrovector space&lt;/a> present relativistic calculations in hyperbolic geometry from a solid group-theoretical viewpoint. Two of his relevant books are &lt;a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analytic Hyperbolic Geometry and Albert Einstein&amp;rsquo;s Special Theory of Relativity&lt;/a> from 2008 and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-306-47134-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond the Einstein Addition Law and its Gyroscopic Thomas Precession&lt;/a> from 2012. This work has even found applications in machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="beyond-special">Beyond special&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The hyperbolic view opens a new window to a universe beyond rewriting calculations in special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hyperbolic geometry efficiently represents &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hierarchical relationships and complex networks&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nickel and Kiela&lt;/a> demonstrated in 2017 that hyperbolic geometry is better than Euclidean geometry when applying machine learning to complex data structures. In a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up paper&lt;/a>, they compared different hyperbolic models for learning hierarchical relationships and found that the Lorentz model is more efficient than the Poincaré model. Around the same time, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ganea, Bécigneul, and Hofmann&lt;/a> derived hyperbolic versions of deep learning tools by using Ungar&amp;rsquo;s gyrovector formalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These papers opened up a new research direction in machine learning on &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04562" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic deep neural networks&lt;/a>. The researchers use tools developed specifically for special relativity, such as Lorentz transformations and gyrovector spaces, to improve machine learning algorithms. Physicists usually associate velocities and universal speed limits with Lorentz transformations. It is fascinating that Lorentz transformations arise in problems without a notion of motion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another application closer to my heart is hyperbolic geometry in general relativity. The spacetime of special relativity is special: we can identify Minkowski space with its tangent space which allows us to talk of spacetime events as four-vectors and apply global Lorentz transformations. These properties do not generalize to arbitrary Lorentzian manifolds. It&amp;rsquo;s not immediately evident that the hyperbolic viewpoint is still valuable when the spacetime is curved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we have seen above, Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s hyperboloid (\ref{2}) consists of points at unit proper distance from the origin. Hyperboloids are as natural in Minkowski space as spheres are in Euclidean space. So &lt;strong>hyperboloidal&lt;/strong> coordinates may be as natural in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can we construct such hyperboloidal coordinates? In many applications, we need to separate spacetime into space and time. Let&amp;rsquo;s separate spacetime into hyperbolic space and time in non-Euclidean style. One approach is to take a hint from spherical coordinates. Generalize the hyperbola from (\ref{2}) to an arbitrary radius of curvature
$$ t^2-x^2 = \tau^2, $$
and use $\tau$ as a new coordinate. Setting $x=\tau \ \sinh \rho$ gives us the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milne universe&lt;/a> with metric
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \tau^2 d\xi^2.$$
These coordinates have various use cases today, including &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum field theory&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holography&lt;/a>, and the theory of &lt;a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial differential equations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another approach is to shift the hyperbola (\ref{2}) along the time direction by $\tau$ recognizing the special role of time
$$ (\tau - t)^2 - x^2 = 1 $$
Using $\tau$ as the new time coordinate, the Minkowski metric becomes
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \frac{2x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} d\tau dx + \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx^2.$$
Level sets of $\tau$ are hyperbolic spaces. We can bring the metric into the more recognizable Poincaré form by the spatial transformation $x=2 \rho/(1-\rho^2)$.
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2} \left(2\rho d\tau d\rho + d\rho^2\right).$$
This construction generalizes to &lt;a href="../../publication/zenginoglu-2008-hyperboloidal/">curved spacetimes&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s favorable for numerically solving wave equations because the coefficients don&amp;rsquo;t depend on time. Some of the problems appearing in standard coordinates, such as the outer boundary and radiation extraction problems, &lt;a href="../../publication/zenginoglu-2011-hyperboloidal/">don&amp;rsquo;t arise with this approach&lt;/a> because we can solve the wave equation on the infinite spatial domain $\rho\in[0,1]$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hyperboloidal coordinates may seem unnatural at first, but that&amp;rsquo;s because we are used to thinking about space and time in Newtonian terms. Once you spend some time with them, you see that hyperboloidal coordinates are as valuable in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds. I devoted most of my &lt;a href="../../publication/">work&lt;/a> exploring properties of these surfaces and I find their relation to special relativity fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperclusion">Hyperclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Physics doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about how we make calculations in special relativity. The Wikipedia page for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lorentz_transformations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of Lorentz transformations&lt;/a> lists many equivalent formalisms. We could keep the usual relativistic formulas using velocities and Lorentz factors, or employ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_k-calculus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bondi&amp;rsquo;s $k$-calculus&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ungar&amp;rsquo;s gyrovector space&lt;/a>. Why choose one over the other?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It may be just personal preference. How do you understand? I understand by analogy, so it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to me when formalisms lend themselves to connections to other fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is another, much more relevant reason to prefer the hyperbolic viewpoint. As scientists, we want powerful descriptions. The same thinking style should apply to a broad class of phenomena. In other words, we want to avoid overfitting our formalism to the phenomena at hand. Hyperbolic calculations translate into machine learning, spacetime curvature, and maybe other areas to be discovered. The non-Euclidean approach with hyperbolic angles seems more powerful than the usual approach with velocities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When physicists want to understand something, they consider idealizations and extremes. To understand spacetime then, consider black holes.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe:
the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chandrasekhar&lt;/a> (1983)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Black holes are simple with just two properties: mass and rotation. By dropping an object into a black hole, you can increase its mass and change its rotation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simplicity of black holes contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, which states that &lt;em>total entropy never decreases&lt;/em>. If black holes are that simple, you can reduce total entropy by dropping a high-entropy object, say a hot teacup, into the black hole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wheeler&lt;/a>, best known for coining the term &amp;ldquo;black hole,&amp;rdquo; tasked one of his graduate students at Princeton, the young &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bekenstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bekenstein&lt;/a>, with resolving this paradox. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general_relativity#Golden_age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golden age&lt;/a> of relativity was in full swing around 1970, and Princeton was among the best places to be. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrios_Christodoulou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christodoulou&lt;/a>, another student of Wheeler, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawking&lt;/a> had just shown that &lt;em>the area of a black hole horizon never decreases&lt;/em>. To resolve the entropy paradox, Bekenstein conjectured that black holes must have entropy and that the entropy must be proportional to the area of the black hole horizon in Planck units. The proportionality constant was determined by the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawking temperature&lt;/a>, which is why we call it the &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein-Hawking_entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bekenstein-Hawking&lt;/a> Black-Hole entropy
$$ S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4 L_P^2}$$
where $A$ is the horizon area, $L_P$ is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planck length&lt;/a>, $S$ stands for entropy (probably after &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sadi Carnot&lt;/a>), and BH stands for &lt;a href="#brief-history-of-bekenstein-hawking-black-hole-entropy">Brief History&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may think this is a curious result about curious objects called black holes with little relevance to our notion of spacetime. But consider the following question: what is the maximum entropy in a finite, say spherical region? If you take some high-entropy matter and squeeze it spherically (with your mind), eventually, you hit the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the compressed matter forms a black hole. This thought experiment leads to the surprising conclusion that the entropy of any matter system is bound by the surface area of the smallest sphere that encloses it&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started with black holes and arrived at the&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="holographic-principle">Holographic Principle&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Counterintuitively, the maximal entropy of a region scales with the area of its boundary, not its volume. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holographic principle&lt;/a> pushes this area-dependence further, suggesting that the dynamics in a volume of space is encoded on the boundary of that space. In other words, the information content of a spacetime region is encoded on the surface of that region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take a break and think about this for a moment. How can our three-dimensional world be encoded on a two-dimensional surface? What does it mean? Is the universe a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game&lt;/a> running on the screen of an alien child? Are we trapped in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Matrix&lt;/a>? Are we &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nqcL0mjMjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Livin' on the Edge&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The most famous realization of the holographic principle is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS/CFT correspondence&lt;/a>. Conjectured by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Mart%C3%ADn_Maldacena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maldacena&lt;/a> in 1997, the correspondence suggests an equivalence between a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">string theory&lt;/a> in curved anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS) and a strongly coupled &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conformal field theory&lt;/a> in a lower-dimensional flat spacetime. Aside from the details, the remarkable aspect of the conjecture is the duality between the bulk and the boundary of AdS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a visual image for the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. The cylinder represents the three-dimensional AdS$_3$ spacetime. On the boundary of the cylinder lives the 1+1 dimensional CFT$_2$. Slices of constant time are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_manifold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic manifolds&lt;/a> with negative curvature, drawn as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poincaré disks&lt;/a>. A gravity theory within the disks is dual to a gravity-free theory on the bounding circle. The boundary of space encodes the bulk.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The negative curvature of AdS is a feature and a bug. It allows the realization of the holographic principle due to its hyperbolic slices, but it also makes AdS an unphysical model for our universe. At cosmological scales, the universe has positive curvature and resembles de Sitter space. At astrophysical and smaller scales, isolated systems are modeled by asymptotically flat spacetimes. Either way, anti-de Sitter spacetime, with all its &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bizarre&lt;/a> features, is not a good model for physical reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can we establish the holographic principle for isolated systems?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbolic-hyperboloidal">Hyperbolic Hyperboloidal&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Consider the AdS$_3$ metric in static coordinates with curvature scale $L$
$$ ds^2_{\rm{AdS}} = - \left(L^2+r^2\right) d\tau^2 + \textcolor{RedViolet}{\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2},$$
Slices of constant time are hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature. Hyperbolic geometry has much more space near its conformal boundary than Euclidean space. It seems that flat spacetime with its Euclidean time slices and vanishing curvature would not allow such a description
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 . $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But now consider the time-shifted spacetime hyperboloid with curvature radius $L$
$$ (\tau-t)^2 - r^2 = L^2 $$
This hypersurface is spacelike everywhere and extends to null infinity. Such surfaces are called hyperboloidal. Solving for $\tau$, we choose the negative square root, so the surfaces extend to future null infinity.
$$ \tau = t - \sqrt{L^2+r^2}.$$
In this hyperboloidal time, Minkowski metric has hyperbolic spatial slices
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 - \frac{2 r}{\sqrt{L^2+r^2}} d\tau dr + \textcolor{RedViolet}{\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2}. $$
Just like AdS, flat spacetime takes the form of hyperbolic space with a time direction. You can draw the spacetime geometry as a cylinder, which is what Penrose did in his first publication on conformal infinity in 1963.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The agreement of the geometry of hyperboloidal and AdS slices is suggestive. Calculations in the AdS/CFT literature performed on time slices may carry over to flat spacetime in hyperboloidal coordinates. One such example is the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rt-if-you-agree">RT if you agree&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ryu and Takayanagi (RT) have &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0603001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed&lt;/a> a relation between geometry in AdS and entropy in CFT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One can interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as a measure of information lost to external observers. The black-hole horizon acts as a screen dividing space into two subsystems inside and outside the horizon. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_of_entanglement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entanglement entropy&lt;/a> is proportional to the area of this screen. The RT conjecture relates the entanglement entropy on CFT to the surface area of a screen in AdS that divides the AdS boundary into subdomains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Words don&amp;rsquo;t do it justice, so let&amp;rsquo;s look at a picture. Below is a diagram from the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0603001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RT paper&lt;/a> for AdS$_3$ /CFT$_2$.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two subsystems $A$ and $B$ of CFT$_2$ live on the boundary of AdS$_3$. They are separated by a screen $\gamma_A$ required to be an extremal surface in the bulk AdS$_3$. An extremal &amp;ldquo;surface&amp;rdquo; on a slice of AdS$_3$ is a geodesic line connecting the meeting points of the domains $A$ and $B$ on the bounding circle. The RT proposal states that the entanglement entropy of subsystem $A$ is proportional to the area of the screen $\gamma_A$:
$$ S_A \sim \rm{Area\ of\ }\gamma_A $$
In this case, we are talking about the length of a geodesic on a time slice. You can easily see that the calculation does not change whether you are in AdS or hyperboloidal Minkowski. In the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu%E2%80%93Takayanagi_conjecture#Example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example on Wikipedia&lt;/a>, the AdS$_3$ metric is written in the spatial coordinate $\rho$ defined through $r=\sinh \rho$, so
$$ ds^2_{\rm{AdS}} = -\cosh^2\rho\ d\tau^2 + \textcolor{Blue}{d\rho^2 + \sinh^2\rho\ d\theta^2}. $$
The same spatial geometry is obtained in hyperboloidal coordinates in Minkowski&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 - \sinh\rho\ d\tau d\rho + \textcolor{Blue}{d\rho^2 + \sinh^2\rho\ d\theta^2}. $$
This flat metric describes a stack of hyperbolic disks, just like the AdS metric. The length of the geodesic and its relation to entanglement entropy are the same in hyperboloidal coordinates. The original RT proposal applies directly to flat spacetime!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RT proposal reveals an interesting interpretation for the area dependence of entropy. It is easier to understand that entanglement entropy should be proportional to the area of a screen and not to the volume behind it. But maybe we should ask first: What is volume?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thinking-outside-the-ball">Thinking outside the ball&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When we think of volume, we typically envision a box or a ball and consider the space inside. Relativity modifies our intuition about space and time, so it is reasonable that our notion of volume is modified as well. The volume of a region $B$ is the integral of the volume form
$$ V_B = \int_{B} \sqrt{\det h} \ d\Sigma, $$
and depends on the spatial metric $h$. In flat space we have $\sqrt{\det h} =$ $r^2 \sin\theta$. The volume of a ball of radius $R$ gives us the usual formula that we memorize at school
$$ V_{B(R)} = \int_{0}^{R} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} r^2 \sin\theta \ dr d\theta d\varphi= 4\pi \int_{0}^{R} r^2 dr = \frac{4\pi}{3}R^3. $$
For the hyperboloidal foliation with $L=1$ we have
$$ h = \frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta d\varphi^2,\quad \sqrt{\det h} = \frac{r^2 \sin\theta}{\sqrt{1+r^2}}. $$
The volume expression changes to
$$ V_{B(R)} = 4\pi \int_{0}^{R} \frac{r^2}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} dr.
% = 2\pi \left[ r\sqrt{1+r^2} - \ln\left( r+\sqrt{1+r^2} \right) \right]&lt;em>{0}^{R}.
$$
We can get a sense for it using Taylor expansions. For small spheres with $R \ll 1$, we get the usual result
$$ V&lt;/em>{B(R)}=\frac{4\pi}{3}R^3+O(R^5).$$
For large spheres, however, the series expansion for $R\gg 1$ gives
$$ V_{B(R)}=2\pi R^2 + O(\ln R).$$
Remarkably, volume and area scale the same way near the asymptotic boundary in hyperboloidal coordinates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are suggestive observations about the potential usefulness of hyperboloidal surfaces in holography. And indeed, there is a current effort using hyperboloidal surfaces for holography.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celestial-holography">Celestial Holography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the context of quantum gravity, the holographic principle suggests duality between a gravity theory in the bulk and a quantum theory on the boundary. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celestial holography&lt;/a> suggests that asymptotically flat spacetimes are dual to a theory living on the &amp;ldquo;celestial sphere&amp;rdquo; at infinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The theory uses Bondi coordinates along null infinity to discuss asymptotic symmetries, and switches to a hyperboloidal slicing to discuss massive particles. The slices they use have been first proposed as a cosmological model by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milne&lt;/a> in 1935. Milne slices are level sets of
$$ \tau^2 = t^2 - r^2.$$
Introducing the spatial coordinate
$$ \rho = \frac{r}{\sqrt{t^2-r^2}}, $$
the Minkowski metric takes the form
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 + \tau^2 \left( \textcolor{RedViolet}{\frac{1}{1+\rho^2} d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2}\right). $$
Again, we recognize the representation of Minkowski spacetime as a stack of hyperbolic disks. But in this case, the metric coefficients depend on time $\tau$. And the mean extrinsic curvature of Milne slices vanishes asymptotically in time as $K=3/\tau$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suspect that the hyperboloidal foliation we discussed &lt;a href="#hyperbolic-hyperboloidal">above&lt;/a> is better than Milne slicing for holography. Consider the Penrose diagram of Milne slices.

The Penrose diagram and the metric reveal some undesirable features of Milne slices compared to the hyperboloidal foliation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The slices intersect at null infinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The coordinates are time-dependent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no analog of the AdS curvature scale.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In contrast, the hyperboloidal foliation has constant mean curvature, $K=3/L$, playing the same role as the curvature scale in AdS geometry. The coordinates are independent of time and provide a smooth foliation of null infinity. Below are Penrose diagrams for such hyperboloidal, constant-mean-curvature foliations with different values of the mean extrinsic curvature, which acts as a dial between characteristic and Cauchy surfaces.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Milne coordinates have one advantage that a hyperboloidal foliation of null infinity cannot provide. A massive particle in constant motion will asymptote to a point on the Milne slices. Dirac used this property in his 1949 paper on &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forms of Relativistic Dynamics&lt;/a> and it appears repeatedly in celestial holography. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how important this is. But Milne coordinates are also hyperboloidal. So in that sense, celestial holography is already using hyperboloidal holography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Celestial holography is relatively new and developing rapidly. We don&amp;rsquo;t know how the final version will look like. That&amp;rsquo;s the excitement of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap up&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A few curious observations suggest that hyperboloidal coordinates are interesting for holography.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Flat spacetime becomes a stack of hyperbolic disks, with a &lt;a href="#hyperbolic-hyperboloidal">cylinder&lt;/a> representing the global picture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The original &lt;a href="#rt-if-you-agree">Ryu-Takayanagi calculations&lt;/a> apply to Minkowski spacetime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#thinking-outside-the-ball">Volume scales as area&lt;/a> near the conformal boundary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spacetime hyperboloids are essential in &lt;a href="#celestial-holography">celestial holography&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Are these observations indicative of a profound duality, an underlying realization of the holographic principle for isolated systems in hyperboloidal coordinates? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. The similarity between Minkowski in hyperboloidal coordinates and AdS is interesting, but it can also be misleading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The observations here are, by their very nature, coordinate-dependent. Suitable coordinates may ease calculations and suggest research directions, but the results should not depend on them. A significant, coordinate-independent difference to the AdS case is the null conformal boundary of asymptotically flat spacetimes. Any realization of the holographic principle will need to incorporate the null boundary and the associated &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi%E2%80%93Metzner%E2%80%93Sachs_group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symmetries&lt;/a> as celestial holography is attempting to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can be misleading to take similarities in specific coordinates too far, but it can also be a missed opportunity to ignore them. I think hyperbolic geometry and hyperboloidal surfaces will keep playing an essential role in holography. &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Watch%20this%20Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch this space!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
