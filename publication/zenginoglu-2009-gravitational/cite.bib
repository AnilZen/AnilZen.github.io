 abstract = {We study gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime by solving a hyperboloidal initial value problem for the Bardeen–Press equation. Compactification along hyperboloidal surfaces in a scri-fixing gauge allows us to have access to the gravitational waveform at null infinity in a general setup. We argue that this hyperboloidal approach leads to a more accurate and efficient calculation of the radiation signal than the common approach where a timelike outer boundary is introduced. The method can be generalized to study perturbations of Kerr spacetime using the Teukolsky equation.},
