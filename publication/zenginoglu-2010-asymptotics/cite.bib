 abstract = {We study linear gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime by solving numerically Regge–Wheeler–Zerilli equations in a time domain using hyperboloidal surfaces and a compactifying radial coordinate. We stress the importance of including the asymptotic region in the computational domain in studies of gravitational radiation. The hyperboloidal approach should be helpful in a wide range of applications employing black hole perturbation theory.},
