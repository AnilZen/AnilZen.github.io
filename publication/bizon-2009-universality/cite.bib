 abstract = {We consider the initial value problem for the spherically symmetric, focusing cubic wave equation in three spatial dimensions. We give numerical and analytical evidence for the existence of a universal attractor which encompasses both global and blowup solutions. As a byproduct we get an explicit description of the critical behaviour at the threshold of blowup.},
